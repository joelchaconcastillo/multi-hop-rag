Furthermore, if the fellowship applicant is from a foreign organization, what additional review criteria must be considered during the application review process, and what approvals are required before funding can be awarded?", "answer": "Individual fellowships are governed by NIH Standard Terms of Award; however, unlike other awards, they do not permit extending the final budget period without additional funds nor allow carryover of unobligated balances. Therefore, any intra-IHE faculty consulting activities that exceed a faculty member's base salary must be carefully budgeted within the approved award period and funds, as no extension or carryover is allowed to accommodate additional expenses. If the fellowship applicant is from a foreign organization, the application will be evaluated not only on standard NIH review criteria but also on whether the project offers special opportunities through unique talent, resources, or conditions abroad, and its relevance to the NIH Institute or Center's mission with potential to advance U.S. health sciences. Importantly, research grant applications from foreign organizations require approval by the IC National Advisory Council or Board before funding can be awarded.

Under NIH GPS section 11.2.9.5, for individual predoctoral fellowships (F30 and F31), tuition and fees are reimbursed at 60% of the amount requested by the sponsoring institution, up to $16,000 per year, or up to $21,000 for dual-degree programs. For individual postdoctoral fellowships (F32 and F33), tuition and fees are reimbursed at 60% up to $4,500 per year, or up to $16,000 if the training involves formal degree-granting courses required for research training. Health insurance costs are excluded from tuition and fees and must be charged under the institutional allowance budget category. According to NIH GPS section 12.9, rebudgeting of funds is permitted within the terms of the award, allowing institutions some flexibility to reallocate funds between budget categories. Therefore, institutions should allocate tuition and fees as direct costs within the specified NIH limits, charge health insurance separately as an institutional allowance, and may use rebudgeting provisions to adjust funds between categories while ensuring compliance with indirect cost allocation principles under 2 CFR Part 200."}

Additionally, how do the Uniform Administrative Requirements under 2 CFR Part 200.410 influence the allowability of these costs under the grant award?", "answer": "According to NIH guidelines, research patient care costs include routine and ancillary services provided by hospitals to individuals participating in research programs. These costs are assigned to specific research projects through research patient care rates. Routine services cover regular room services and minor supplies without separate charges, while ancillary services include special services like x-rays and laboratory tests within the hospital. Key exclusions from research patient care costs are personal expense reimbursements (e.g., patient travel), fees for ancillary tests performed outside the hospital on a fee-for-service basis, recruitment or retention fees, and data management or statistical analysis costs. Hospitals encompass all types of medical facilities, and research patients include inpatients, outpatients, volunteers, or donors involved in research protocols. Costs must be allocated using a cost-finding process that apportions expenses from non-revenue-producing centers to revenue-producing centers based on statistical data measuring service usage. For an independent CDA recipient responsible for planning and executing the research, these principles ensure that only allowable costs directly related to patient care in the research context are charged to the grant. Under 2 CFR Part 200.410, costs must be reasonable, necessary, and allocable to the federal award to be allowable. Therefore, research patient care costs identified per NIH definitions and properly allocated using cost-finding techniques comply with federal cost principles, supporting their allowability under the grant award. Any costs excluded by NIH policy or not meeting federal criteria for allowability must not be charged to the award."}

When incurring travel costs without an established written policy, the organization must apply travel rates and amounts established under 5 U.S.C. 5701-11, as administered by the General Services Administration or the President\u2019s designee, per \u00a7 200.432(d). Additionally, any travel costs, including commercial air travel, require approval by the Federal awarding agency as stated in \u00a7 200.432. The organization must also incorporate the terms and conditions available in Appendix XII as referenced in \u00a7 200.113 to ensure compliance with recipient integrity and performance requirements.

Specifically, can a sponsoring institution charge pre-award costs such as stipends or tuition under a fixed amount award for an individual fellowship, and what steps should be taken to ensure compliance with both NIH and federal regulations?", "answer": "Under 2 CFR 200.1, Federal awards include various types such as fixed amount awards, which provide a set funding amount without regard to actual costs incurred, thereby reducing administrative and record-keeping burdens. NIH GPS 11.2.9.1 clearly states that pre-award costs for individual fellowships are limited: stipends and tuition and fees may not be charged until the fellowship award is activated and appropriate paperwork is submitted. Institutional allowances may only rarely be allowable as pre-award costs, and consultation with the NIH awarding Institute or Center (IC) is advised. The cost principles in 2 CFR 200.431(b)(3)(i) govern allowable compensation costs and must be adhered to when charging costs. Combining these, even under a fixed amount award, stipends and tuition cannot be charged as pre-award costs for individual fellowships before activation, as this would conflict with NIH policy and federal cost principles. Institutional allowances might be charged pre-award only with prior NIH IC approval. Therefore, sponsoring institutions must ensure that the award is activated with all required paperwork before charging stipends or tuition and seek NIH IC guidance regarding any pre-award institutional allowance charges to remain compliant with both NIH and federal regulations."}

Pension costs must be allocated according to GAAP (except for State and local governments) and funded within six months after the fiscal year to which they apply, using either a pay-as-you-go or actuarial cost method recognized by GAAP and consistent with the recipient's written policies. Unfunded pension costs cannot be charged directly to Federal awards unless allocable, and any refunds or credits related to pension costs must be equitably shared with the Federal Government. Additionally, when incurring travel costs under the award, the recipient must comply with the Fly America Act (NIH GPS 4.1.11), which mandates the use of U.S. flag air carriers for air travel funded by Federal awards, except in limited circumstances. Therefore, the recipient must integrate proper cost allocation for pension and facility usage with adherence to Fly America Act travel requirements to ensure full compliance with Federal regulations governing award expenditures."}

During the NIH application review process (NIH GPS 13.4), the Scientific Review Group (SRG) evaluates the budget based on total effort and resources and may recommend adjustments in entire budget modules. The award budget will be noncategorical, specifying total direct costs and F&A costs, and may be reduced by the IC to align with cost management plans. Additionally, under federal regulation 2 CFR 200.463(d)(4), costs for conferences and training must be necessary, reasonable, and allocable to the federal award. Therefore, the recipient must carefully plan and document training expenses within these constraints, justify them during the peer review and award process, and manage monthly expenditures to comply with both NIH policy and federal cost principles."}

When managing funds related to NIH Loan Repayment Program postdoctoral fellows, which may be considered 'other income' as noted in NIH GPS 11.2.10.5, recipients should include these funds in their budget comparisons to ensure they align with the approved budget. If any discrepancies arise or if amounts are determined to be owed back to the Federal government\u2014such as unallowable costs or excess funds\u2014then the procedures outlined in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.346 must be followed.

The audit must systematically review internal accounting and control systems to provide reasonable assurance that financial operations are properly conducted, financial reports are timely and accurate, applicable laws and grant terms are complied with, resources are managed efficiently, and objectives are achieved effectively. Specifically, the auditor must assess whether the recipient's financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards are fairly presented in all material respects, and must perform procedures to understand and test internal controls over Federal programs to support a low assessed risk of noncompliance for major programs. This includes planning and executing testing of internal controls as guided by the compliance supplement and frameworks such as COSO. Regarding the tax treatment of Kirschstein-NRSA stipends, Section 117 of the Internal Revenue Code allows degree candidates to exclude qualified tuition and related expenses from gross income, but non-degree candidates must report stipends and tuition as gross income. Importantly, NIH clarifies that Kirschstein-NRSA stipends are not considered salaries, and recipients are not deemed employees of NIH or the sponsoring institution solely due to the award. Thus, the taxability of these stipends does not alter the recipient's employment classification. NIH does not provide tax advice, and individuals should consult the IRS for personal tax obligations."}
