{"id": "applied_medium_2", "question": "What are the requirements and review process for transitioning from the K99 phase to the R00 phase in the NIH Pathway to Independence Award?", "prediction": "The transition from the K99 phase to the R00 phase in the NIH Pathway to Independence Award involves specific requirements and a defined review process as outlined below:\n\n**Requirements for Transitioning from K99 to R00 Phase:**\n\n1. **Securing an Independent Position:**  \n   The K99 award recipient must secure a tenure-track, full-time assistant professor position or an equivalent independent research position to be eligible to transition to the R00 phase. This is a mandatory requirement for the transition (Documents 1 and 6, Section 12.2.3.2.3).\n\n2. **Timing and Duration of K99 Phase:**  \n   - The K99 phase generally lasts up to 2 years, but recipients may transition earlier if they have secured an acceptable independent position.  \n   - It is expected that recipients will receive at least 12 months of mentored research career development support during the K99 phase before transitioning (Documents 2, 5, and 7, Section 12.2.3.2.2 and 12.2.3.2.1).  \n   - If independence is achieved prior to starting the K99 phase, neither the K99 nor the R00 phase will be awarded (Documents 2, 5, and 7).\n\n3. **No Delay Between Phases:**  \n   There should be no delay between the end of the K99 phase and the start of the R00 phase to ensure a smooth transition (Documents 1 and 6).\n\n4. **No-Cost Extensions:**  \n   - Since the K99 and R00 phases are awarded independently, a no-cost extension of the K99 phase may be allowed if additional time is needed to complete career development goals.  \n   - No-cost extensions require prior NIH approval and are not automatic. During the extension, all terms and conditions of the award remain in effect.  \n   - Recipients requesting a no-cost extension should submit a plan for continued career development and timely transition to an independent position.  \n   - If an application for the R00 phase with a suitable position is not submitted within one year of the no-cost extension, the R00 phase will not be awarded (Documents 2 and 7).\n\n5. **Carryover of Funds:**  \n   Carryover of funds from the K99 to the R00 phase may be allowed if the K99 phase was funded by extramural support, but recipients should consult with the awarding Institute or Center (IC) regarding specific practices (Documents 2, 4, 7, and 9).\n\n**Review Process for Transition:**\n\n- The transition application for the R00 phase is subject to an administrative review by NIH staff and is **not peer-reviewed** by a study section (Documents 1, 3, 6, and 8, Section 12.2.3.2.3 and 12.2.3.2).  \n- Approval of the transition application is contingent upon the awarding IC's administrative review and approval (Documents 3 and 8).  \n- Transition to the R00 phase is **not guaranteed**; it depends on meeting the requirements and successful administrative review (Documents 1 and 6).\n\n**Additional Expectations:**\n\n- R00 award recipients are expected to compete successfully for independent R01 support from NIH during the R00 phase (Documents 1 and 6).\n\n**Summary:**\n\nTo transition from the K99 to the R00 phase, the awardee must secure a tenure-track or equivalent independent research position, have completed at least 12 months of mentored career development during the K99 phase, and submit a transition application that undergoes administrative review by NIH staff. The transition is not automatic or guaranteed, and there should be no gap between the two phases. No-cost extensions of the K99 phase are possible but require NIH approval and a plan for transition. Carryover of funds may be allowed under certain conditions. Once transitioned, R00 recipients are expected to pursue independent NIH funding (e.g., R01 grants).\n\nFor more detailed information, applicants are referred to the NIH New Investigators Program web page under Pathway to Independence Award: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/new_investigators/#indaward (Documents 1 and 6).\n\n---\n\n**References:**  \n- Documents 1, 3, 6, 8 (Section 12.2.3.2 and 12.2.3.2.3)  \n- Documents 2, 5, 7 (Section 12.2.3.2.2 and 12.2.3.2.1)  \n- Documents 4, 9 (Carryover information)"}

If the transfer involves a change in mentor, supporting documentation from the new mentor is required. This documentation should demonstrate that the new mentor has extensive and appropriate research experience, is recognized as an accomplished investigator in the proposed research area, has a track record of success in training independent investigators, and has sufficient independent research support to cover costs beyond the CDA award (see Documents 2, 5, 7, 8, and 10).\n\n2. **Approval from NIH Awarding Institute/Center (IC):**  \n   The transfer of the CDA to another institution requires the approval of the NIH awarding IC. This approval is necessary for any transfer of the award or project change (Documents 3 and 8).\n\n3. **Change of Recipient Organization Policies:**  \n   The transfer must comply with the Change of Recipient Organization policies described in the NIH terms, applicable when the transfer is between domestic institutions (Documents 3 and 8).\n\n4. **Consultation with NIH Staff:**  \n   It is strongly encouraged to consult with the applicable NIH program staff and/or grants management staff when a change of institution and/or mentor is being considered to ensure compliance with all requirements (Documents 2 and 7).\n\n5. **Restrictions on Transfer:**  \n   Individual mentored and non-mentored CDAs may not be transferred to another PD/PI. The award remains with the original recipient, who must continue the career development under the new institution and mentor (Documents 3 and 8).\n\n6. **Other Considerations:**  \n   The recipient must continue to meet all terms and conditions of the award, including full-time appointment and minimum effort requirements, during any extension period or transfer (Document 7).\n\n**Summary:**  \n- A mentored CDA can be transferred to another domestic institution.  \n- The recipient must have a mentor at the new institution; if the mentor changes, supporting documentation from the new mentor is required.  \n- NIH awarding IC approval is mandatory for the transfer.  \n- Consultation with NIH program and grants management staff is strongly recommended.  \n- The award cannot be transferred to another PD/PI; it remains with the original recipient.  \n- All award terms and conditions continue to apply during and after the transfer.\n\n**References:**  \n- Transfer and mentor requirements: Documents 2, 3, 7, 8  \n- Mentor qualifications and documentation: Documents 5, 10  \n- NIH approval and policies: Documents 3, 8  \n- Consultation recommendation: Documents 2, 7"}
{"id": "applied_medium_6", "question": "How should salaries and fringe benefits be handled in NIH grant budgets according to section 12.8.1?", "prediction": "According to section 12.8.1 of the NIH grant terms and conditions, salaries and fringe benefits in NIH grant budgets must be handled as follows:\n\n1. **Consistency with Institutional Policies:**  \n   Requested salary and fringe benefit amounts must align with institutional policies that are applied consistently to individuals in similar circumstances. These amounts must also be supported by acceptable accounting principles. If full-time, 12-month salaries are not currently paid to comparable staff members, the proposed salary must be appropriately related to the existing salary structure (Documents 4 and 9, Section 12.8.1).\n\n2. **Basis for Salary Requests on Career Development Awards (CDAs):**  \n   For CDA grants, salary amounts requested must be based on the investigator\u2019s institutional base salary (IBS) prorated for their commitment on the project. While salary and fringe benefit information is initially provided in the application, confirmation of these costs may be required before the award is issued (Documents 4 and 9, Section 12.8.1).\n\n3. **Salary Caps and Limits:**  \n   Salary costs charged to NIH grants cannot exceed the applicable legislative salary cap. The salary cap varies by NIH Institute or Center (IC) and is noted in the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO). The salary limit applies only to salary; fringe benefits are provided in addition to the salary. Candidates are advised to contact the relevant awarding IC for specific guidelines and allowable funds (Documents 4, 8, and 9).\n\n4. **Salary Supplementation:**  \n   Recipient institutions may supplement the NIH salary contribution on CDAs up to a level consistent with the institution's salary scale. However, such supplementation must come from non-Federal sources (including institutional funds). Public Health Service (PHS) funds may not be used for salary supplementation. Additionally, supplementation must not require extra duties or responsibilities that would interfere with the goals of the CDA (Documents 4 and 9, Section 12.8.1).\n\n5. **Effort and Compensation on Other Grants:**  \n   For effort not directly committed to the CDA, recipients may devote effort with compensation on other Federal or non-Federal grants as PD/PI or in other roles, provided the specific aims of those grants differ from the CDA (Documents 4 and 9).\n\n6. **Rebudgeting Authority:**  \n   NIH IC limitations on awarded salary levels do not restrict the recipient institution\u2019s authority to rebudget the total awarded costs to cover additional salary charges, as long as such rebudgeting remains within the total awarded amount (Documents 4 and 9).\n\n7. **Documentation and Allowability:**  \n   Salary and wage amounts charged to grant-supported projects must be based on an adequate payroll distribution system that documents the distribution according to Federal Cost Principles and institutional policies consistently applied. Compensation costs, including fringe benefits, are allowable to the extent they are reasonable, conform to established policies, and reflect the percentage of time actually devoted to the NIH-funded project. Direct salary is exclusive of fringe benefits and Facilities & Administrative (F&A) costs (Documents 1 and 6).\n\n8. **Limit on Total Compensation:**  \n   The total salary paid to an individual from all sources, including NIH grants and other compensation paid by the employer, may not exceed 100% of that individual\u2019s regular salary from their organization (Documents 1 and 6).\n\n9. **Restrictions on Use of Funds When Career Development Awards Are Issued:**  \n   Funds budgeted for an individual\u2019s salary and fringe benefits under an NIH grant but freed up due to that individual receiving a K award (a type of CDA) may not be used for other purposes without prior NIH approval (Documents 2 and 7).\n\nIn summary, salaries and fringe benefits in NIH grant budgets must be reasonable, consistent with institutional policies, documented properly, and comply with legislative salary caps. Salary supplementation is allowed only from non-Federal sources and must not interfere with award goals. Institutions have some flexibility in rebudgeting within awarded amounts, but total compensation cannot exceed the individual\u2019s regular institutional salary. Confirmation of salary and fringe benefit costs may be required before award issuance, and special rules apply when Career Development Awards are involved.\n\n**References:**  \n- Section 12.8.1 Salaries and Fringe Benefits (Documents 4 and 9)  \n- Salary Cap/Salary Limitation (Documents 3 and 8)  \n- Standards for Documentation of Personnel Expenses (Documents 1 and 6)  \n- Retention of Research Grant Funds When a Career Development Award is Issued (Documents 2 and 7)"}
{"id": "applied_medium_7", "question": "How should an organization allocate indirect costs such as depreciation, interest, operation and maintenance, and general administration according to 2 CFR Part 200.1?", "prediction": "According to 2 CFR Part 200, specifically the appendices related to indirect (Facilities & Administration, F&A) costs, an organization should allocate indirect costs such as depreciation, interest, operation and maintenance, and general administration by following a structured process involving identification, classification, pooling, and distribution of these costs. The key points are as follows:\n\n1. **Definition and Identification of Indirect Costs**  \n   Indirect costs are those incurred for common or joint objectives and cannot be readily identified with a particular final cost objective (2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200, 2.c.(4), Documents 2 and 7). Examples include general administration, operation and maintenance of physical plant, depreciation, and library expenses.\n\n2. **Classification into Cost Pools**  \n   Indirect costs must be grouped into cost pools, typically classified into two broad categories:  \n   - **Facilities** (including depreciation, interest, operation and maintenance of physical plant)  \n   - **Administration** (including general administration and general expenses)  \n   (2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200, 2.c.(4), Documents 5 and 10).\n\n3. **Establishing the Distribution Base**  \n   The organization must establish a distribution base, commonly the Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC) base, which consists of all the institution's direct functions (2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200, 3.b., Documents 1 and 6). MTDC typically excludes certain items such as equipment, capital expenditures, and subawards over $25,000.\n\n4. **Calculation of Indirect Cost Rate**  \n   The indirect cost rate is calculated by dividing the total amount in the indirect cost pool by the amount of the distribution base (MTDC). This rate is then applied to the modified total direct costs of individual agreements to determine the allocable indirect costs (2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200, 3.b., Documents 1 and 6).\n\n5. **Allocation Methods**  \n   - **Regular Method:** Indirect costs are accumulated in pools and allocated to benefiting functions based on a distribution base that best measures the relative benefit (2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200, 2.c.(4), Documents 2 and 5).  \n   - **Direct Allocation Method:** Other cost categories should be allocated in an order determined appropriate by the organization, with the possibility of cross allocation between indirect cost categories if it results in a more equitable allocation (2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200, 2.c.(4), Document 5).  \n   - **Simplified Method:** For governmental units with one major function or where all functions benefit equally, a simplified allocation procedure may be used (2 CFR Appendix-VII-to-Part-200, B.6., Documents 4 and 9).\n\n6. **Special Considerations**  \n   - Separate indirect cost pools and rates may be developed for particular segments of work if they generate significantly different levels of indirect costs (2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200, 2.c.(4), Documents 3 and 8).  \n   - Certification of indirect costs is required to assure that expenditures are proper and in accordance with award documents (2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200, 3.b., Documents 1 and 6).\n\n**Summary:**  \nAn organization should allocate indirect costs by first identifying and grouping these costs into appropriate pools (Facilities and Administration), then establishing a distribution base (usually MTDC), calculating an indirect cost rate by dividing the indirect cost pool by the distribution base, and finally applying this rate to individual agreements to allocate indirect costs. Allocation methods should ensure equitable distribution based on the relative benefit to each function or award, with provisions for special rates where necessary.\n\n**References:**  \n- 2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200, Sections 2.c.(4) and 3.b.

This process is intended to ensure fairness, transparency, and the selection of the best-qualified applicants in accordance with the agency's written standards.\n\nKey points supporting this objective include:\n\n1. **Selection of Most Meritorious Recipients**:  \n   According to \u00a7 200.205 (Documents 1 and 6), unless prohibited by Federal statute, Federal agencies must design and execute a merit review process with the objective \"to select recipients most\" (the text is truncated but clearly indicates selecting the most meritorious recipients).\n\n2. **Objective Evaluation Based on Written Standards**:  \n   The merit review is described as an objective process of evaluating Federal award applications in accordance with the written standards of the Federal agency (Documents 2 and 7). These standards specify how many reviewers participate and emphasize inclusion of diverse participants, including those representing underserved communities.\n\n3. **Transparency and Fairness**:  \n   The process must be transparent to allow applicants to make informed decisions when preparing applications, thereby maximizing fairness (Document 4 and 9). This includes clear descriptions of review criteria, their relative importance, any statutory or regulatory preferences, and how cost sharing is considered.\n\n4. **Use of Merit Review Outcomes in Decision-Making**:  \n   Agencies must describe how merit review outcomes are used in final award decisions, whether advisory or determinative, and who makes the final selections (Documents 3 and 8).

These mandates are detailed separately because they can vary each fiscal year and impose restrictions on the use of NIH grant funds, cooperative agreements, and contract awards.\n\nTo find these specific appropriation mandates for a given fiscal year, you should refer to the list of Appropriation Mandates applicable to that fiscal year, which is made available on the NIH Office of Extramural Research (OER) website. This is explicitly stated in the NIH Grants Policy Statement sections 4.2 Appropriation Mandates in Documents 1 and 6, which say:\n\n> \"A list of Appropriation Mandates applicable to each fiscal year can be found on the OER web site.\" (Documents 1 and 6, Section 4.2)\n\nAdditionally, the broader context of public policy requirements, objectives, and other appropriation mandates applicable to NIH awards is discussed in Sections 4 of Documents 2 and 7. These sections explain that NIH recipients must comply with requirements contained in the HHS annual appropriations act and other Federal statutes, which include appropriation mandates that may be updated or changed annually.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- The appropriation mandates are statutory provisions limiting NIH grant fund usage and are updated annually.\n- The specific mandates for each fiscal year are compiled and published on the NIH Office of Extramural Research (OER) website.\n- These mandates are referenced in the NIH Grants Policy Statement under Section 4.2 Appropriation Mandates.\n- Recipients are responsible for complying with these mandates as part of the terms and conditions of their awards (see Documents 5 and 10, Part II terms and conditions).\n\nTherefore, to find the current and specific appropriation mandates for a given fiscal year, you should consult the NIH OER website where the annual list is posted, and also review the relevant sections of the NIH Grants Policy Statement, particularly Section 4.2.\n\n### References:\n- Document 1, Section 4.2 Appropriation Mandates\n- Document 6, Section 4.2 Appropriation Mandates\n- Document 2 and 7, Section 4 Public Policy Requirements, Objectives and Other Appropriation Mandates\n- Document 5 and 10, Part II Terms and Conditions of NIH Grants and Cooperative Agreements"}
{"id": "applied_medium_15", "question": "What distinguishes questioned costs from improper payments under federal grant compliance?", "prediction": "Questioned costs and improper payments are related but distinct concepts in the context of federal grant compliance, as clarified in the provided documents.\n\n**Definition and Distinction:**\n\n- **Questioned Costs:** According to 2 CFR 200.1 (Document 1 and Document 6), questioned costs are amounts that are questioned by auditors because they may not comply with applicable laws, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the federal award. These costs are identified during audits or reviews and represent costs that are potentially unallowable, unsupported, or otherwise improper. Importantly, questioned costs include both \"known\" and \"likely\" questioned costs, meaning auditors consider the entire population from which a sample was drawn, not just the specific costs identified.\n\n- **Improper Payments:** Improper payments are a subset of questioned costs but are specifically defined and confirmed as improper payments only after review, as per OMB Circular A-123 Appendix C (referenced in Document 1 and Document 6). This means that not all questioned costs are improper payments until they have been reviewed and confirmed to meet the criteria of improper payments.\n\n**Key Distinguishing Point:**\n\n- The critical distinction is that **questioned costs become improper payments only after a review and confirmation process**. Questioned costs are initially identified by auditors as potentially problematic, but improper payments require a formal determination that the payment was made in error, was unsupported, or violated applicable requirements.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n- Auditors report questioned costs as audit findings when they exceed certain thresholds (e.g., greater than $25,000) and provide context for evaluating their prevalence and consequences (Document 3 and Document 8, Section 200.512).\n\n- The process for resolving questioned costs, especially related to indirect costs for educational institutions, involves negotiation with the cognizant agency for indirect costs (Document 4 and Document 9). This negotiation can lead to adjustments or reimbursements if costs are determined to be unallowable.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Questioned Costs:** Potentially unallowable costs identified during audits; not yet confirmed as improper.\n- **Improper Payments:** Questioned costs that have been reviewed and confirmed as improper payments according to OMB Circular A-123 Appendix C.\n\nThis distinction ensures that not all audit-identified issues immediately result in improper payment findings, allowing for due process and resolution before final determination.\n\n**References:**\n\n- 2 CFR 200.1 \u201cQuestioned cost\u201d (Documents 1 and 6)\n- OMB Circular A-123 Appendix C (as referenced in Documents 1 and 6)\n- Audit reporting requirements and thresholds for questioned costs (Documents 3 and 8, Section 200.512)\n- Procedures for resolving questioned costs (Documents 4 and 9)"}

{"id": "applied_medium_18", "question": "How are applications from foreign organizations evaluated during the NIH initial review process?", "prediction": "The retrieved documents provide a general overview of the NIH peer review process and eligibility criteria for applications, including those from foreign organizations, but do not specify any unique or different evaluation procedures specifically for applications from foreign organizations during the NIH initial review process.\n\nHere is a detailed synthesis based on the available information:\n\n1. **Eligibility of Foreign Organizations**  \n   According to Document 5 (Section 2.3.2 Eligibility) and Document 10 (Section 2.3.2 Eligibility), NIH grants may be awarded to a broad range of organizations, including foreign entities. Eligible organizations include domestic or foreign, public or private, non-profit or for-profit entities such as governments, institutions of higher education, non-profit organizations, hospitals, and occasionally individuals. Any special eligibility criteria or requirements for the Principal Investigator (PD/PI) or other staff are specified in the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), program guidelines, or other publicly available documents.\n\n2. **NIH Peer Review Process Overview**  \n   Documents 1 and 6 (Section 2.4) describe the NIH peer review process as a \"dual review system\" involving two sequential levels of review:  \n   - Initial review by an Initial Review Group (IRG) or Scientific Review Group (SRG)  \n   - Second-level review by the Institute/Center (IC) National Advisory Council/Board for scientific merit  \n   \n   The process is designed to be fair, equitable, timely, and to strive to eliminate bias. It applies to all competing applications for NIH grants and cooperative agreements, including renewals and revisions. The process has evolved to accommodate collaborative and multidisciplinary research but maintains the core principle of fairness and objectivity.\n\n3. **Evaluation of Applications from Foreign Organizations**  \n   The documents do not explicitly state that applications from foreign organizations are evaluated differently or under special criteria during the initial peer review. The peer review process is intended to be equitable and unbiased for all applications regardless of the applicant\u2019s domestic or foreign status (Documents 1 and 6).  \n   \n   Therefore, applications from foreign organizations undergo the same initial peer review process as domestic applications, which includes evaluation by an IRG or SRG for scientific and technical merit.\n\n4. **Appeals Process**  \n   If applicants, including those from foreign organizations, believe the initial peer review was procedurally flawed, they may appeal the review outcome as described in Documents 2 and 7 (Section 2.4.2). The appeal must be based on specific allowable issues such as evidence of bias, conflict of interest, or lack of appropriate expertise within the review group. The appeal process requires concurrence from the Authorized Organization Representative (AOR) and is designed to preserve fairness in the peer review system.\n\n5. **Additional Notes**  \n   - The documents mention that any special criteria or requirements for eligibility or qualifications will be specified in the NOFO or program guidelines (Documents 5 and 10).  \n   - There is no indication that foreign applications receive special treatment or separate review panels solely based on their foreign status.\n\n**Summary:**  \nApplications from foreign organizations are eligible for NIH funding and are evaluated through the same NIH initial peer review process as domestic applications. This process involves an initial review by an IRG or SRG focusing on scientific merit, followed by a second-level review by the IC National Advisory Council/Board. The process is designed to be fair, equitable, and unbiased, with no special differentiation mentioned for foreign applicants. Appeals of the initial review are possible under defined circumstances to ensure fairness (Documents 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 10).\n\n---\n\n**References:**  \n- Document 1, Section 2.4: NIH Peer Review Process Overview  \n- Document 2, Section 2.4.2: Appeals of Initial Scientific Review  \n- Document 5, Section 2.3.2: Eligibility of Foreign Organizations  \n- Document 6, Section 2.4: NIH Peer Review Process Overview  \n- Document 7, Section 2.4.2: Appeals of Initial Scientific Review  \n- Document 10, Section 2.3.2: Eligibility of Foreign Organizations"}
{"id": "applied_medium_19", "question": "What are participant support costs according to 2 CFR \u00a7 200.456, and how should they be treated in an indirect cost rate proposal?", "prediction": "According to 2 CFR \u00a7 200.456, participant support costs are defined as allowable costs that are specifically for participants or trainees in conferences, workshops, seminars, or similar activities. These costs typically include items such as stipends or subsistence allowances, travel allowances, and registration fees paid to or on behalf of participants or trainees (see Documents 1, 3, 6, 7, and 8 referencing \u00a7 200.456 and \u00a7 200.1).\n\nThe classification of costs as participant support costs must be clearly documented in the recipient's or subrecipient's written policies and procedures and must be treated consistently across all Federal awards (Documents 3 and 8, \u00a7 200.1). This ensures uniformity and compliance in how these costs are identified and charged.\n\nRegarding the treatment of participant support costs in an indirect cost rate proposal, the regulations indicate that participant support costs are generally excluded from the indirect cost base. This means that these costs should not be included when calculating the indirect cost rate because they are direct costs specifically identifiable with the participant support activities (implied from the need for consistent classification and treatment, and from the general principles of indirect cost rate development discussed in Documents 4, 5, 9, and 10).\n\nMore specifically, Document 4 and Document 9 (sections referencing indirect cost rate development) explain that indirect cost rates are developed based on the organization's total costs minus certain exclusions. Participant support costs are typically excluded from the indirect cost pool and base because they are direct costs that do not benefit from indirect cost allocation. If an organization receives more than $10 million in direct Federal funding, the indirect cost components may be broken out into categories such as Facilities and Administration, but participant support costs remain excluded from these calculations (Documents 4 and 9).\n\nFurthermore, Document 5 and Document 10 discuss the negotiation and approval of indirect cost rates, including the possibility of special indirect cost rates when different segments of work generate significantly different levels of indirect costs. However, participant support costs are not part of the indirect cost pool and thus are not included in these indirect cost rate calculations.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Participant support costs** are direct costs for participants or trainees in federally funded activities such as conferences or workshops, including stipends, travel, and registration fees (\u00a7 200.456; Documents 1, 3, 6, 7, 8).\n- These costs must be documented in the recipient\u2019s written policies and treated consistently across all Federal awards (\u00a7 200.1; Documents 3, 8).\n- **Participant support costs are excluded from the indirect cost rate base** and should not be included in the calculation of indirect cost rates (Documents 4, 5, 9, 10).\n- Indirect cost rates are negotiated and approved based on costs excluding participant support costs, and special rates may be developed for different segments of work, but participant support costs remain outside the indirect cost pools (Documents 5, 10).\n\nThis treatment ensures that participant support costs are charged directly to the Federal award and are not burdened with indirect costs, reflecting their nature as direct, identifiable expenses related to participants.\n\n**References:**\n\n- 2 CFR \u00a7 200.456 Participant support costs (Documents 1, 3, 6, 7, 8)\n- 2 CFR \u00a7 200.1 Allowable costs and documentation requirements (Documents 3, 8)\n- Indirect cost rate development and exclusions (Documents 4, 5, 9, 10)"}
{"id": "applied_medium_20", "question": "What factors must be considered when determining if a selected item of cost is allowable under federal grants according to 2 CFR \u00a7 200.420?", "prediction": "When determining if a selected item of cost is allowable under federal grants according to 2 CFR \u00a7 200.420 and related sections, several key factors and principles must be considered. These factors ensure that costs charged to federal awards are reasonable, allocable, consistent, and conform to applicable rules and limitations. The comprehensive criteria are as follows:\n\n1. **General Allowability Requirements (\u00a7 200.402 and \u00a7 200.403)**  \n   - The cost must meet the general requirements outlined in \u00a7\u00a7 200.402 through 200.411.  \n   - Costs must be properly supported by approved cost allocation plans consistent with applicable cost accounting principles (\u00a7 200.402(b)).  \n   - Costs must not be borne directly or indirectly by the Federal Government through other means (\u00a7 200.402(c)).  \n   - Costs must meet specific criteria for allowability under federal awards, except where otherwise authorized by statute (\u00a7 200.403).  \n   - Although \u00a7\u00a7 200.403(1) and (2) mention specific arrangements like loans, scholarships, and capitation awards, these are examples and not an exhaustive list.\n\n2. **Four Fundamental Tests of Allowability (as elaborated in Documents 5 and 10, Sections 7.2)**  \n   These tests apply regardless of whether the cost is direct or indirect and regardless of the specific category of cost:  \n   - **Reasonableness (Including Necessity):**  \n     A cost is reasonable if a prudent person would have incurred it under the circumstances prevailing at the time the decision was made. Considerations include whether the cost is necessary for the organization's operations or the grant's performance, compliance with organizational policies, and prudent management of public funds.  \n   - **Allocability:**  \n     A cost is allocable to a federal award if it is incurred solely to advance work under the award, benefits both the award and other work, or is necessary to the overall operation of the organization and assignable to the award in part. Allocability must be based on the relative benefits received or other equitable relationships.  \n   - **Consistency:**  \n     Costs must be treated consistently across all activities of the organization under similar circumstances, regardless of funding source. For example, a cost cannot be charged as a direct cost in one instance and as an indirect cost in another for the same purpose.  \n   - **Conformance:**  \n     Costs must conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in the federal award terms and conditions, including those in the cost principles. This varies by activity type, recipient type, and award characteristics.\n\n3. **Additional Specific Requirements for Allocable Costs (\u00a7 200.405)**  \n   - Costs must conform to any limitations or exclusions in the cost principles or federal award regarding types or amounts of cost items (\u00a7 200.405(b)).  \n   - Costs must be consistent with policies and procedures that apply uniformly to federally financed and other activities of the recipient or subrecipient (\u00a7 200.405(c)).  \n   - Costs must be accorded consistent treatment, i.e., not assigned as a direct cost if similar costs have been allocated as indirect costs (\u00a7 200.405(d)).  \n   - Costs must be determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), except as otherwise provided for certain entities (\u00a7 200.405(e)).  \n   - Costs must not be included as a cost or used to meet cost sharing requirements of any other federally financed award (\u00a7 200.405(f)).\n\n4. **Case-by-Case Determination and Examples (\u00a7 200.402(b))**  \n   - The regulations do not provide an exhaustive list of allowable or unallowable costs. Each cost item\u2019s allowability should be determined based on the treatment of similar or related costs.  \n   - Specific examples, such as advertising costs, are allowable only under certain conditions (e.g., recruitment of personnel required for the federal award) as detailed in NIH grant terms (Documents 3 and 8).\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo determine if a selected cost item is allowable under federal grants per 2 CFR \u00a7 200.420 and related sections, the cost must:  \n- Be reasonable and necessary for the grant or organization\u2019s operations.  \n- Be allocable to the federal award based on benefit or equitable relationship.  \n- Be treated consistently across all activities and funding sources.  \n- Conform to any limitations or exclusions in the award or cost principles.  \n- Be supported by proper documentation and cost allocation plans.  \n- Not be charged to multiple federal awards or used for cost sharing elsewhere.  \n- Comply with GAAP and uniform policies.\n\nThese principles ensure prudent and equitable use of federal funds and are detailed in \u00a7\u00a7 200.402, 200.403, 200.405, and elaborated in NIH grant cost considerations (Documents 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 10).\n\n**References:**  \n- 2 CFR \u00a7 200.402, \u00a7 200.403, \u00a7 200.405 (Documents 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9)  \n- NIH Grant Cost Considerations, Sections 7.2 and 7.9.1 (Documents 3, 5, 8, 10)"}

However, none of the documents explicitly describe the specific purpose or content of the \"Budget IIA-62\" section within NIH grant compliance.\n\nFrom the information available:\n\n- Part II of the NIHGPS includes the terms and conditions of NIH grants and cooperative agreements and is incorporated by reference in all NIH grant awards. Subpart A (IIA) includes terms and conditions that apply generally to NIH awards (Documents 2 and 7).\n\n- The NIHGPS and its incorporated terms and conditions are intended to ensure compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements, including 2 CFR Part 200, appropriations acts, and other federal mandates (Documents 2 and 7).\n\n- NIH uses a project period system of funding, where projects are approved for the entire period but funded in annual increments called budgets (Document 4 and 9, Section 5.3).\n\n- The NIH Standard Terms of Award, which are part of the federalwide standard terms and conditions, are implemented within the NIHGPS framework to create consistency in administration (Documents 3 and 8, Section 3.1).\n\nGiven these points, it can be inferred that the Budget section within IIA (including IIA-62) likely pertains to the terms and conditions governing the budgeting and funding aspects of NIH grants, such as the annual budget increments, allowable costs, and compliance with appropriation mandates. This would align with the general purpose of Subpart A (IIA) to set forth the standard terms and conditions applicable to all NIH awards.\n\nHowever, the documents do not provide a direct or detailed explanation of the primary purpose of the Budget IIA-62 section specifically.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe primary purpose of the Budget IIA-62 section in NIH grant compliance is not explicitly detailed in the provided documents. Based on the context of Subpart A (IIA) and references to funding and budget increments (Sections 5.3 in Documents 4 and 9), it can be reasonably inferred that Budget IIA-62 addresses the terms and conditions related to budgeting and funding of NIH grants, ensuring compliance with federal requirements and appropriations.

{"id": "applied_medium_27", "question": "What are the reporting requirements for grants awarded to for-profit organizations under NIH guidelines?", "prediction": "The retrieved documents provide general information about the NIH Grants Policy Statement (NIHGPS) and its structure, including that Part II of the NIHGPS contains the \"Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards,\" which includes specific provisions for different types of recipients, including for-profit organizations. However, the documents do not provide detailed or explicit reporting requirements specifically for grants awarded to for-profit organizations under NIH guidelines.\n\nKey points from the documents relevant to your question are:\n\n1. **NIH Grants Policy Statement (NIHGPS) Structure**  \n   - The NIHGPS is organized into three parts:  \n     - Part I: General information about NIH grants and processes.  \n     - Part II: Terms and conditions of NIH grant awards, including specific terms for different types of recipients such as for-profit organizations (see Document 2 and Document 7).  \n     - Part III: Points of contact.  \n   - Part II includes chapters that specify terms and conditions that apply to particular types of grants and recipients, including grants to for-profit organizations (Document 2, Document 7).\n\n2. **Reporting Requirements for NIH Award Recipients**  \n   - NIH award recipients are subject to reporting requirements established by Public Law 112-239, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, and as provided in Appendix XII to 2 CFR Part 200.  \n   - Specifically, NIH recipients with currently active Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 must comply with these reporting requirements (Document 1 and Document 6, Section 4.1.34).  \n   - This implies that for-profit organizations receiving NIH grants that meet these thresholds are subject to these federal reporting requirements.\n\n3. **Terms and Conditions Flow Down**  \n   - The terms and conditions of NIH grant awards apply not only to the primary recipients but also flow down to subawards and subrecipients unless otherwise specified (Document 2, Introduction).  \n   - This suggests that reporting requirements and other conditions would also apply to for-profit organizations if they are subrecipients or primary recipients.\n\n**What is Missing:**  \n- The documents do not provide the specific details or examples of the reporting requirements (e.g., financial reports, progress reports, specific forms or systems to be used) that are uniquely applicable to for-profit organizations.  \n- There is no explicit section or excerpt detailing the frequency, format, or content of reports required from for-profit recipients.  \n- The documents mention that Part II of the NIHGPS contains these terms and conditions but do not include the actual text or summary of the reporting requirements for for-profit organizations.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the NIH Grants Policy Statement (Part II) includes terms and conditions that apply to grants awarded to for-profit organizations, including reporting requirements, the retrieved documents do not provide the detailed reporting requirements themselves. NIH award recipients, including for-profit organizations with substantial federal funding (over $10 million cumulatively), must comply with federal reporting requirements as per Public Law 112-239 and 2 CFR Part 200, Appendix XII.

{"id": "applied_medium_28", "question": "What are indirect costs according to 2 CFR Appendix IV to Part 200, and how should minor direct costs be treated?", "prediction": "According to 2 CFR Appendix IV to Part 200, indirect costs are defined as costs \"that have been incurred for common or joint objectives and cannot be readily identified with a particular final cost objective\" (Documents 2 and 7, 2 CFR Appendix IV to Part 200, B. Allocation of Indirect Costs and Determination of Indirect Cost Rates, 1. General). This means indirect costs are expenses that support multiple activities or projects and are not directly attributable to any single one.\n\nRegarding the treatment of minor direct costs, the regulation states that \"Direct cost of minor amounts may be treated as indirect costs\" (Documents 2 and 7). This provision allows organizations some flexibility to classify small direct costs as indirect costs to simplify accounting and cost allocation.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- **Indirect costs** are those costs incurred for common or joint objectives that cannot be easily assigned to a specific final cost objective.\n- **Minor direct costs** may be treated as indirect costs, allowing for practical and administrative ease in cost allocation.\n\nThese definitions and treatments are found explicitly in 2 CFR Appendix IV to Part 200, sections on the allocation of indirect costs (Documents 2 and 7).\n\nAdditional context from other documents (e.g., Documents 1 and 6) discusses indirect cost rates and their negotiation but does not redefine indirect costs or the treatment of minor direct costs beyond what is stated above.\n\n### References:\n- 2 CFR Appendix IV to Part 200, B.

This means that if the applicant requests $20,000 per year, NIH will fund 60% of that amount, which is $12,000 per year, since 60% of $20,000 is $12,000 and this is below the $21,000 cap (the maximum allowed for combined dual-degree programs) (see Document 2, Section 11.2.9.5; Document 3, Section 11.3.8.3; Document 7, Section 11.2.9.5; Document 8, Section 11.3.8.3).\n\n- The policy explicitly states that for individual predoctoral fellowships (F30 and F31), the tuition and fees provided are 60% of the requested amount, up to $16,000 per year for regular predoctoral programs, and up to $21,000 per year for combined dual-degree programs such as M.D.-Ph.D. (Documents 2, 3, 7, and 8).\n\n- Health insurance costs are no longer included in the tuition and fees budget but are moved to the Institutional Allowance budget category for predoctoral fellowships (Document 2, Section 11.2.9.5).\n\n- Pre-award costs for tuition and fees may not be charged until the fellowship award is activated and appropriate paperwork is submitted to NIH (Document 1 and Document 6, Section 11.2.9.1).\n\nIn summary, for a $20,000 per year tuition and fees request for a combined M.D.-Ph.D. program under an individual predoctoral fellowship, NIH will provide 60% of the requested amount, which is $12,000 per year, since this is below the $21,000 maximum allowed for such dual-degree programs.\n\n### References:\n- Document 2, Section 11.2.9.5: Tuition and Fees policy for individual predoctoral fellowships.\n- Document 3, Section 11.3.8.3: Trainee Tuition and Fees policy.\n- Document 7, Section 11.2.9.5: Tuition and Fees policy (reiteration).\n- Document 8, Section 11.3.8.3: Trainee Tuition and Fees policy (reiteration).\n- Document 1 and Document 6, Section 11.2.9.1: Pre-award costs limitations."}
{"id": "applied_medium_30", "question": "What is the NIH policy on rebudgeting funds within a grant?", "prediction": "The NIH policy on rebudgeting funds within a grant is outlined primarily in Sections 12.9 and 8.1.2.2 of the NIH Grants Policy Statement (NIHGPS), as well as in the terms and conditions incorporated by reference in NIH grant awards.\n\nKey points of the NIH policy on rebudgeting funds are as follows:\n\n1. **General Rebudgeting Within Direct Cost Categories**  \n   - Funds awarded on Cooperative Agreement (CDA) grants may typically be rebudgeted within direct cost categories without prior approval from NIH.  \n   - However, there may be specific restrictions on rebudgeting noted in the Notice of Award (NoA), which recipients must follow.  \n   - This is stated in Document 1 (Section 12.9) and reiterated in Document 6 (Section 12.9).\n\n2. **Restrictions on Rebudgeting Salary Funds Freed by Career Awards**  \n   - Rebudgeting of salary funds in an NIH-supported research grant that become available as a result of a career award (i.e., salaries or fringe benefits of individuals freed by the career award) may not be rebudgeted without prior approval from the NIH awarding Institute or Center (IC).  \n   - This restriction is specifically noted in Document 1 and Document 6 (both Section 12.9).\n\n3. **Rebudgeting into Alterations and Renovations (A&R) Costs**  \n   - NIH prior approval is required if a recipient wishes to rebudget more than 25% of the total approved budget for a budget period into A&R costs.  \n   - Prior approval is also required for any lesser rebudgeting into A&R costs if such rebudgeting would result in a change in scope of the project.  \n   - Addition of a Major A&R project through rebudgeting is considered a change in scope and requires NIH approval.  \n   - These requirements are detailed in Document 4 and Document 9 (Section 8.1.2.2).\n\n4. **Compliance with Terms and Conditions and Statutory Requirements**  \n   - NIH grant awards are subject to the terms and conditions incorporated by reference, including the NIHGPS, grant program legislation, program regulations cited in the NoA, and applicable statutory requirements such as appropriations acts and 2 CFR Part 200.  \n   - Recipients must comply with all these requirements, and any award-specific terms and conditions may further restrict rebudgeting.  \n   - This is explained in Documents 3 and 8 (Part II sections).\n\n5. **Notice of Award (NoA) and Award-Specific Terms**  \n   - The NoA may include specific restrictions or requirements regarding rebudgeting that override general policies.  \n   - Recipients should carefully review the NoA for any such conditions.  \n   - This is emphasized in Documents 1, 3, 6, and 8.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Generally, NIH allows rebudgeting of funds within direct cost categories without prior approval unless otherwise restricted by the NoA or specific policies.  \n- Salary funds freed by career awards require prior NIH approval before rebudgeting.  \n- Rebudgeting into Alterations and Renovations costs exceeding 25% of the budget or causing a change in scope requires prior NIH approval.  \n- Recipients must comply with all terms and conditions of the award, including statutory and regulatory requirements.  \n- Always consult the NoA and award-specific terms for any additional restrictions.\n\n**References:**  \n- Rebudgeting policy: Documents 1 and 6 (Section 12.9)  \n- Alterations and Renovations rebudgeting: Documents 4 and 9 (Section 8.1.2.2)  \n- Terms and conditions and compliance: Documents 3 and 8 (Part II)  \n- Notice of Award restrictions: Documents 1, 3, 6, and 8"}
