{"id": "applied_easy_2", "question": "What is required for a K99 award recipient to transition to the R00 phase?", "prediction": "To transition from the K99 phase to the R00 phase of the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00), several requirements must be met as outlined in the provided documents:\n\n1. **Securing an Independent Position**  \n   The K99 award recipient must secure a tenure-track, full-time assistant professor position or an equivalent independent research position. This is a mandatory condition for transitioning to the R00 phase, which supports independent research (Documents 2 and 7, Sections 12.2.3.2.3).\n\n2. **Minimum Duration of K99 Support**  \n   It is expected that recipients will receive at least 12 months of career development support during the K99 phase before transitioning. Although the K99 phase is generally up to 2 years, earlier transition is possible if an acceptable independent position is offered (Documents 1 and 6, Sections 12.2.3.2.2).\n\n3. **Administrative Review and Approval**  \n   The transition to the R00 phase is contingent upon an administrative review and approval by the awarding NIH Institute or Center (IC). The transition application for the R00 phase is administratively reviewed by NIH staff and is not subject to peer review by a study section (Documents 2, 5, 7, and 10, Sections 12.2.3.2.3 and 12.2.3.2).\n\n4. **No Delay Between Phases**  \n   There should be no delay between the end of the K99 phase and the start of the R00 phase to ensure continuity of support (Documents 2 and 7, Sections 12.2.3.2.3).\n\n5. **Early Transition and Prior Approval**  \n   If the recipient wishes to transition earlier than 12 months or before the full 2 years of the K99 phase, this requires prior approval from NIH. Early transition is considered a prior approval request and must be coordinated with the awarding IC (Documents 1 and 6, Sections 12.2.3.2.2).\n\n6. **No-Cost Extensions**  \n   If additional time is needed to complete the goals of the K99 phase, a no-cost extension may be requested but requires prior NIH approval. During such an extension, the recipient should submit a plan for continued career development and a timely transition to an independent position. Failure to submit an R00 application with a suitable position within one year of the no-cost extension will result in no R00 award (Documents 1 and 6, Sections 12.2.3.2.2).\n\n7. **Expectation for Future Funding**  \n   R00 award recipients are expected to compete successfully for independent R01 funding from NIH during the R00 phase (Documents 2 and 7, Sections 12.2.3.2.3).\n\nIn summary, the key requirements for a K99 award recipient to transition to the R00 phase are: securing a suitable independent tenure-track or equivalent position, completing at least 12 months of mentored career development support under the K99, submitting a transition application for administrative review and approval by NIH, and ensuring no gap between the phases. Early transitions and no-cost extensions require prior NIH approval and appropriate planning (Documents 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 10).\n\n**References:**  \n- Documents 1, 6 (Section 12.2.3.2.2) \u2013 K99 Phase details and early transition requirements  \n- Documents 2, 7 (Section 12.2.3.2.3) \u2013 Transition to R00 phase requirements  \n- Documents 5, 10 (Section 12.2.3.2) \u2013 Overall K99/R00 program objectives and conditions"}

{"id": "applied_easy_5", "question": "Is approval required to transfer a Career Development Award (CDA) to another institution or make a project change?", "prediction": "Yes, approval is required to transfer a Career Development Award (CDA) to another institution or to make a project change.\n\nSpecifically, according to Document 1 (Section 12.12) and Document 6 (Section 12.12), the approval of the NIH awarding Institute or Center (IC) is required for both a transfer of the CDA to another institution and for any project change. It is also noted that individual mentored and non-mentored CDAs may not be transferred to another PD/PI.\n\nFor transfers between domestic institutions, the Change of Recipient Organization policies described in section IIA apply to Individual CDAs. For mentored CDAs, the recipient must have a mentor at the new institution. If the transfer involves a change in mentor, supporting documentation from the new mentor will be required (Documents 1, 3, 6, and 8, all Section 12.12).\n\nFurthermore, consultation with the applicable NIH program staff and/or grants management staff is strongly encouraged when a change of institution is being considered (Documents 3 and 8, Section 12.12).\n\nIn summary:\n- NIH awarding IC approval is mandatory for transferring a CDA to another institution or making a project change.\n- Transfers must comply with Change of Recipient Organization policies.\n- For mentored CDAs, a mentor at the new institution is required, and if the mentor changes, documentation from the new mentor must be provided.\n- Consultation with NIH staff is recommended before initiating a transfer.\n\nThese requirements ensure that the candidate\u2019s career development plan and institutional commitments remain appropriate and supported throughout the award period.\n\nReferences:  \n- Document 1, 3, 6, 8 (Section 12.12)"}

{"id": "applied_easy_7", "question": "What does MTC stand for and how are indirect costs allocated according to 2 CFR Part 200.1?", "prediction": "Based on the retrieved documents, the following comprehensive answer addresses what MTC stands for and how indirect costs are allocated according to 2 CFR Part 200.1:\n\n**1. What does MTC stand for?**\n\nMTC stands for **Modified Total Direct Costs (MTDC)**. This is explicitly stated in Document 1 and Document 6 (Section 200.1), which clarify that:\n\n- \"The MTC is the modified total direct costs (MTDC), as described in \u00a7 200.1, plus the allocated indirect cost proportion.\"  \n- The MTDC includes certain direct costs but excludes others such as equipment, capital expenditures, charges for patient care, tuition remission, scholarships and fellowships, participant support costs, and the portion of each subaward in excess of $25,000 (as per the general definition of MTDC in 2 CFR Part 200, though not fully detailed in the retrieved excerpts).\n\nThus, MTC here refers to the base of direct costs modified by excluding certain items, to which indirect costs are then proportionally allocated.\n\n**2. How are indirect costs allocated according to 2 CFR Part 200.1?**\n\nThe allocation of indirect costs is described in Document 1 and Document 6 (Section 200.1), which provide the following details:\n\n- Expenses included in indirect costs are grouped according to the major functions of the organization to which they render services or provide benefits.\n- The aggregate expenses of each group are then allocated to the benefiting functions based on MTC.\n- There is a specified **order of distribution** for indirect cost categories:\n  - Indirect cost categories such as depreciation, interest, operation and maintenance, and general administration and general expenses must be allocated **in that order** to the remaining indirect cost categories as well as to the major functions of the organization.\n\nThis means that indirect costs are first grouped by category, then allocated sequentially starting with depreciation, followed by interest, then operation and maintenance, and finally general administration/general expenses. After these allocations, the costs are distributed to the major functions or cost objectives based on the modified total direct costs (MTC) base.\n\n**Additional Context on Indirect Cost Rates and Negotiation:**\n\nWhile not directly answering the question, the documents also provide context on indirect cost rates:\n\n- Indirect cost rates may be negotiated and approved by a cognizant federal agency (Documents 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10).\n- Rates can be predetermined, fixed, final, or provisional, depending on the nature of the agreement and timing (Document 2, 7).\n- Separate indirect cost pools and rates may be established for different segments of work if they generate significantly different levels of indirect costs (Document 2, 7).\n- Indirect cost proposals must be certified and include documentation supporting the allocation and allowability of costs (Documents 5, 10).\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **MTC (Modified Total Direct Costs)** is the base of direct costs used for allocating indirect costs, excluding certain direct cost items.\n- Indirect costs are allocated by grouping expenses by major organizational functions and then distributing these costs to benefiting functions based on the MTC.\n- The allocation follows a specific order of distribution among indirect cost categories: depreciation, interest, operation and maintenance, and general administration/general expenses.\n\n**References:**\n\n- Document 1 (Section 200.1): Definition of MTC and order of distribution of indirect costs.\n- Document 6 (Section 200.1): Reiteration of MTC and allocation method.\n- Documents 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10: Additional context on indirect cost rates, negotiation, and certification.\n\nThis explanation aligns with the regulatory framework in 2 CFR Part 200 regarding indirect cost allocation and the use of Modified Total Direct Costs as the allocation base."}

{"id": "applied_easy_12", "question": "What is the objective of a Federal agency's merit review process for discretionary Federal awards?", "prediction": "The objective of a Federal agency's merit review process for discretionary Federal awards is to select recipients most meritorious based on an objective evaluation of applications in accordance with the agency's written standards. This process is designed to ensure fairness, transparency, and the selection of the best-qualified applicants to receive Federal awards.\n\nKey points about the merit review process objective and design include:\n\n1. **Primary Objective**:  \n   The merit review process aims to select recipients most meritorious among applicants for discretionary Federal awards. This means identifying those applicants whose proposals best meet the agency\u2019s criteria and standards for funding (see Document 1, \u00a7 200.205; Document 6, \u00a7 200.205).\n\n2. **Objective Evaluation**:  \n   The process is an objective evaluation of applications against written standards established by the Federal agency. These standards specify how applications will be judged and the criteria used to assess merit (Document 2, 2 CFR 200.205; Document 7, 2 CFR 200.205).\n\n3. **Transparency and Fairness**:  \n   The merit review process must be transparent to applicants, including clear descriptions of the review criteria, their relative importance, and any statutory or regulatory preferences applied. This transparency helps applicants prepare informed and competitive applications, thereby maximizing fairness (Document 4, 2 CFR Appendix-I-to-Part-200(b)(6)(i)(B); Document 9, 2 CFR Appendix-I-to-Part-200(b)(6)(i)(B)).\n\n4. **Diverse Participation**:  \n   The agency\u2019s standards should provide for a diverse group of reviewers, including those representing underserved communities, to participate in the merit review process. This diversity helps ensure a broad perspective and equitable evaluation (Document 2, 2 CFR 200.205; Document 7, 2 CFR 200.205).\n\n5. **Use in Decision-Making**:  \n   The merit review outcomes inform the final award decisions. The process may be advisory or directly influence selections, and agencies must describe how merit review results are used in making final award decisions (Document 3 and 8, 2 CFR Appendix-I-to-Part-200(b)(6)(iii)(A)(1)).\n\n6. **Review Criteria and Selection Process**:  \n   The merit review includes specific criteria and sub-criteria, with relative weights or points assigned as appropriate. Agencies may also consider program policies or factors such as geographic dispersion, program balance, or diversity during the selection phase after merit review (Document 4 and 9, 2 CFR Appendix-I-to-Part-200(b)(6)(i)(B) and (iii)).\n\nIn summary, the merit review process is a structured, objective, and transparent evaluation designed to select the most qualified recipients for discretionary Federal awards, ensuring fairness and adherence to agency standards and statutory requirements.\n\n**References:**  \n- 2 CFR \u00a7 200.205 (Documents 1, 2, 6, 7)  \n- 2 CFR Appendix I to Part 200, Sections (b)(6)(i)(B), (b)(6)(iii)(A)(1) (Documents 3, 4, 8, 9)"}

{"id": "applied_easy_14", "question": "What are appropriation mandates in NIH grants?", "prediction": "Appropriation mandates in NIH grants refer to statutory provisions and specific requirements contained in the annual appropriations acts that limit or govern the use of funds awarded through NIH grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts. These mandates are legally binding restrictions or conditions attached to the expenditure of federal funds by NIH recipients and are subject to change annually based on the language of the governing Health and Human Services (HHS) appropriation acts.\n\nKey points about appropriation mandates in NIH grants include:\n\n1. **Nature and Purpose**:  \n   Appropriation mandates are statutory provisions that restrict or direct how NIH grant funds may be used. They are intended to ensure that federal funds are expended responsibly and in accordance with social, economic, or other public policy objectives. These mandates help prevent improper financial gain and ensure that research funded by NIH is conducted in a safe, ethical, and high-quality environment.  \n   (See Document 2, Section 4; Document 7, Section 4)\n\n2. **Annual Updates and Variability**:  \n   Because appropriation mandates are based on the annual HHS appropriation acts, they may change from year to year. NIH provides a list of appropriation mandates applicable to each fiscal year on the Office of Extramural Research (OER) website. This means recipients must stay informed about current mandates that apply to their awards.  \n   (See Document 1, Section 4.2; Document 6, Section 4.2)\n\n3. **Scope and Applicability**:  \n   These mandates apply broadly to NIH grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts, affecting recipients, subrecipients, and contractors. They are part of the overall public policy requirements and objectives that NIH enforces to ensure responsible stewardship of federal funds.  \n   (See Document 2, Section 4; Document 7, Section 4)\n\n4. **Incorporation into Terms and Conditions**:  \n   Appropriation mandates are incorporated by reference into the terms and conditions of NIH awards. They supplement other statutory and regulatory requirements, such as those found in the NIH Grants Policy Statement (NIHGPS), 2 CFR Part 200, and specific award notices (NoA). Recipients are responsible for complying with all these requirements, including appropriation mandates.  \n   (See Document 4 and Document 9, Part II and Subpart A)\n\n5. **Examples of Requirements**:  \n   While the documents do not list specific appropriation mandates, they indicate that these may include restrictions on the use of funds for certain activities, requirements to prevent conflicts of interest, and mandates to maintain safe and healthful working conditions. Some mandates have been included in appropriations acts for several years with little or no change, but NIH may add or modify these requirements as needed.  \n   (See Document 2, Section 4; Document 7, Section 4)\n\nIn summary, appropriation mandates in NIH grants are legally binding statutory provisions derived from the annual HHS appropriation acts that restrict or direct the use of NIH grant funds. They are part of the broader public policy requirements NIH imposes to ensure responsible and ethical use of federal funds in research and related activities. These mandates are incorporated into the terms and conditions of NIH awards and may change annually, requiring recipients to remain current with applicable requirements.\n\n**References:**  \n- Document 1, Section 4.2  \n- Document 2, Section 4  \n- Document 4, Part II and Subpart A  \n- Document 6, Section 4.2  \n- Document 7, Section 4  \n- Document 9, Part II and Subpart A"}
{"id": "applied_easy_15", "question": "What does the term 'questioned cost' mean according to 2 CFR 200.1?", "prediction": "According to 2 CFR 200.1, the term \"questioned cost\" refers to costs that are identified during an audit or review that may not be allowable, reasonable, or allocable under the applicable federal cost principles or the terms and conditions of the federal award. Specifically, the documents indicate the following key points about \"questioned costs\":\n\n- Questioned costs are those costs that are questioned by auditors because of potential noncompliance with laws, regulations, or contract terms. These costs may be disallowed if found to be improper.\n- When auditors evaluate questioned costs, they consider both known questioned costs and likely questioned costs extrapolated to the entire population from which a sample was drawn (Documents 4 and 9).\n- Importantly, questioned costs are not automatically considered improper payments. They only become improper payments after a review and confirmation process, as defined in OMB Circular A-123 Appendix C (Documents 4 and 9).\n- The definition and treatment of questioned costs are part of the audit and compliance framework under 2 CFR Part 200, which governs Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Documents 3, 4, 8, and 9).\n\nIn summary, \"questioned cost\" means a cost that is under scrutiny during an audit for potential disallowance or noncompliance but is not definitively improper until confirmed through further review.\n\nThis understanding is drawn primarily from the excerpts in Documents 4, 8, and 9, which provide the most detailed explanation of the term within 2 CFR 200.1."}

However, these documents explicitly note at the end:  \n  \"The provisions in this subsection do not apply to fellowship awards.\"\n\nTherefore, while NIH grants in general may be eligible for a one-time no-cost extension of the final budget period without additional funds, this policy explicitly excludes fellowship awards, including Individual Fellowships. Similarly, the carryover of unobligated balances is not permitted under these provisions for Individual Fellowships.\n\n### Summary:\n- NIH Individual Fellowships are governed by the NIH Standard Terms of Award.\n- The specific provisions allowing extension of the final budget period without additional funds and carryover of unobligated balances **do not apply** to Individual Fellowships.  \n- This exclusion is explicitly stated in NIH policy documents (see Documents 1, 6, 2, and 7).\n\n**References:**  \n- Document 1, Section 11.2.13.8  \n- Document 6, Section 11.2.13.8  \n- Document 2, Section 8.1.1.3  \n- Document 7, Section 8.1.1.3"}

{"id": "applied_easy_18", "question": "How are applications from foreign organizations evaluated during the NIH review process?", "prediction": "Applications from foreign organizations are eligible for NIH grants and are evaluated through the same peer review process as domestic applications, ensuring fairness, equity, and elimination of bias.\n\n**Eligibility of Foreign Organizations:**\n- NIH grants may be awarded to both domestic and foreign organizations, including public or private, non-profit or for-profit entities. Eligible organizations include governments, institutions of higher education, non-profit organizations, hospitals, and occasionally individuals (Documents 3 and 8, Section 2.3.2 Eligibility).\n\n**Peer Review Process:**\n- All competing applications, including those from foreign organizations, undergo a \"dual review system\" consisting of two sequential levels:\n  1. Initial review by an Institute or Center (IC) Referral Group (IRG) or Scientific Review Group (SRG).\n  2. Second-level review for scientific merit by the IC National Advisory Council or Board.\n- This process is designed to be fair, equitable, timely, and to minimize bias (Documents 2 and 7, Section 2.4 The Peer Review Process).\n\n**Fairness and Objectivity:**\n- NIH policy ensures that the review process is conducted in a manner that strives to eliminate bias and is based on scientific merit.\n- The peer review system has evolved to accommodate collaborative and multidisciplinary research but maintains the core principle of fairness and objectivity (Documents 2 and 7, Section 2.4).\n\n**Appeals Process:**\n- If applicants, including foreign organizations, believe the initial peer review was procedurally flawed, they may appeal the review outcome.\n- Appeals must be submitted within 30 calendar days after the second level of peer review and must describe specific flaws such as bias, conflict of interest, or lack of appropriate expertise in the review panel.\n- The appeal requires concurrence from the Authorized Organization Representative (AOR) of the applicant institution (Documents 5 and 10, Section 2.4.2 Appeals of Initial Scientific Review).\n\n**Summary:**\nForeign organization applications are treated equivalently to domestic applications in NIH\u2019s peer review process.

{"id": "applied_easy_21", "question": "What are the key features and eligibility requirements for short-term research training under NIH T32 and T35 mechanisms?", "prediction": "The key features and eligibility requirements for short-term research training under the NIH T32 and T35 mechanisms are as follows:\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n1. **Mechanisms and Purpose:**\n   - NIH offers two short-term research training programs for students in health professional schools:\n     - T32: Traditional institutional research training grants that may include short-term positions.\n     - T35: Separate training grant mechanism exclusively supporting short-term trainees.\n   - Both mechanisms provide full-time short-term research training experiences typically lasting 2 to 3 months (8 to 12 weeks).\n   - The short-term training aims to provide health-professional students with opportunities to participate in biomedical, behavioral, or clinical research to attract them into research careers (Documents 1, 2, 6, 7).\n\n2. **Duration and Timing:**\n   - Short-term research training positions should last at least 8 weeks but no more than 12 weeks.\n   - These experiences are often scheduled during summer or other \u201coff-quarter\u201d periods to accommodate students\u2019 academic calendars (Documents 2, 7).\n\n3. **Full-Time Requirement:**\n   - All short-term training must be full-time (Documents 1, 6).\n\n4. **Research Areas:**\n   - Training must be in areas within the NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) missions, including biomedical, behavioral, social, or clinical research.\n   - The institution must have a strong research program and adequate staff and facilities to support the training (Documents 5, 10).\n\n5. **Encouragement for Multiple Appointments:**\n   - Health-professional students and students in quantitative sciences are encouraged to obtain multiple periods of short-term research training during their degree programs, which may be consecutive or during off-quarter periods (Documents 2, 7).\n\n6. **Stipends:**\n   - Current stipend levels for short-term training are published in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts (Documents 1, 6).\n\n7. **Institutional Responsibility:**\n   - Short-term positions should be requested explicitly in the T32 application.\n   - Since some NIH ICs do not support or only support short-term positions on a limited basis under T32, applicants are urged to contact the relevant NIH IC before requesting short-term positions (Documents 2, 7).\n\n8. **T35 Specifics:**\n   - The T35 mechanism is used by only a few NIH ICs.\n   - The program intent and student eligibility requirements for T35 are similar to those for T32.\n   - Interested applicants should contact specific ICs for details about T35 (Documents 2, 7).\n\n**Eligibility Requirements:**\n\n1. **Eligible Trainees:**\n   - Medical students, dental students, students in other health-professional programs, and graduate students in physical or quantitative sciences (e.g., physics, mathematics, engineering) are eligible for short-term positions under T32.\n   - In schools of pharmacy, only candidates for the Pharm.D. degree are eligible (Documents 2, 7).\n\n2. **Enrollment and Academic Standing:**\n   - Students must be enrolled and in good standing in their programs.\n   - They must have completed at least one quarter or semester in a program leading to a clinical doctorate or a doctorate degree in a quantitative science before participating (Documents 2, 7).\n\n3. **Exclusions:**\n   - Individuals already matriculated in a formal research degree program in the health sciences, those holding a research doctorate or master\u2019s degree, or a combined professional and research doctorate are normally not eligible for short-term training positions (Documents 2, 7).\n\n4. **Program Level:**\n   - Short-term training is intended primarily for predoctoral students (Documents 2, 7).\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n- The Kirschstein-NRSA institutional research training grants (including T32 and T35) are designed to develop or enhance research training opportunities for individuals training for careers in biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research, with an emphasis on diversity and inclusion (Documents 3, 8).\n- Training activities supported can be in basic biomedical or clinical sciences, behavioral or social sciences, health services research, or other disciplines relevant to the NIH mission (Documents 3, 8).\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- NIH short-term research training under T32 and T35 provides full-time, 8-12 week research experiences primarily for health-professional and quantitative science students.\n- Eligibility requires enrollment in relevant degree programs, good academic standing, and completion of at least one academic term.\n- The programs aim to attract students into research careers by offering supervised research training in NIH mission-relevant areas.\n- T32 short-term positions are part of broader institutional training grants, while T35 grants exclusively support short-term training and are less commonly used.\n- Applicants should verify support availability with NIH ICs before applying.\n\n**References:**\n\n- Document 1, 2, 6, 7: Sections 11.3.2.5.3 Short-Term Research Training\n- Document 3, 8: Section 11.3.1 General overview of Kirschstein-NRSA training grants\n- Document 5, 10: Section 11.3.2.2 Research Areas"}

This means that indirect costs are expenses that support multiple activities or projects and are not directly attributable to any single one (Documents 3 and 8, 2 CFR Appendix IV to Part 200, Section B.1).\n\nMore specifically, indirect costs include general administration and general expenses that benefit more than one cost objective. They are allocated to Federal awards and other benefitting activities based on a distribution base such as Modified Total Direct Costs (MTDC), which includes salaries, wages, fringe benefits, materials and supplies, services, travel, and a portion of subawards (Documents 5 and 10, 2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200, Section C).\n\nThe regulation also notes that indirect costs are identified and assigned through the development of indirect cost pools, which aggregate the indirect costs for major functions of an institution (e.g., organized research, instruction). These pools are then allocated to benefitting activities using an appropriate base to determine an indirect cost rate (Documents 5 and 10).\n\nIn summary, indirect costs under 2 CFR Appendix IV to Part 200 are those costs incurred for common or joint objectives that cannot be directly linked to a specific project or final cost objective, typically including general administration and general expenses, and are allocated to Federal awards through negotiated indirect cost rates based on cost pools and distribution bases.\n\n**References:**\n\n- 2 CFR Appendix IV to Part 200, Section B.1: \"Indirect costs are those that have been incurred for common or joint objectives and cannot be readily identified with a particular final cost objective.\" (Documents 3 and 8)\n- 2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200, Section C: Description of indirect cost pools, distribution bases, and allocation methods (Documents 5 and 10)."}

Kirschstein National Research Service Awards terms and conditions.\n\n1. **Coverage Amounts:**\n\n   - **Individual Predoctoral Fellowships (F30 and F31):**  \n     NIH provides an amount equal to 60% of the level requested by the sponsoring institution, up to a maximum of $16,000 per year.  \n     For programs supporting formally combined dual-degree training (e.g., M.D.-Ph.D., D.D.S.-Ph.D.), the amount provided can be up to $21,000 per year.  \n     (See Documents 2, 4, and 7; Sections 11.2.9.5 and 11.3.8.3)\n\n   - **Individual Postdoctoral Fellowships (F32) and Senior Fellowships (F33):**  \n     NIH provides an amount equal to 60% of the level requested by the applicant institution, up to $4,500 per year.  \n     If the program supports postdoctoral individuals in formal degree-granting training, the amount can be up to $16,000 per year.  \n     Tuition and fees for postdoctoral fellows are allowable only if required for specific courses in support of the research training.  \n     (See Documents 2, 4, and 7; Sections 11.2.9.5 and 11.3.8.3)\n\n2. **Health Insurance Costs:**  \n   Health insurance costs are not included in the tuition and fees budget item. Instead, these costs are moved into the Institutional Allowance budget category for both predoctoral and postdoctoral fellowships, making the treatment consistent across fellowship levels.  \n   (See Documents 2 and 7; Section 11.2.9.5)\n\n3. **Pre-Award Costs Restrictions:**  \n   Tuition and fees, along with stipends, may not be charged to an individual fellowship award until the fellow has officially activated the award and the appropriate paperwork has been submitted to NIH. Therefore, these costs cannot be charged as pre-award costs to individual fellowships.  \n   There are rare exceptions where costs associated with the institutional allowance may be allowable as pre-award costs, but these require consultation with the NIH awarding Institute or Center (IC).  \n   (See Documents 1 and 6; Section 11.2.9.1)\n\n4. **Allowable Charges and Consistency:**  \n   Tuition and fees are allowable trainee costs only if such charges are applied consistently to all individuals in a similar training status at the organization, regardless of their source of support.  \n   For postdoctoral trainees, tuition is limited to that required for specific courses supporting the approved training program and requires prior approval from the NIH awarding IC.  \n   (See Documents 4 and 9; Section 11.3.8.3)\n\n5. **Institutional Allowance:**  \n   NIH awards an institutional allowance to help support training costs, including some costs related to health insurance and other training-related expenses. The institutional allowance is a fixed amount, not subject to NIH prior approval, and the institution manages expenditures according to its policies.  \n   (See Documents 5 and 10; Section 11.2.9.4)\n\n**Summary:**  \n- NIH provides tuition and fees funding for individual predoctoral fellowships at 60% of the requested amount, up to $16,000/year (or $21,000/year for dual-degree programs).  \n- For individual postdoctoral fellowships, NIH provides 60% of the requested amount, up to $4,500/year (or $16,000/year for formal degree-granting training).  \n- Tuition and fees cannot be charged before award activation.  \n- Health insurance costs are covered under the institutional allowance, not tuition and fees.  \n- Tuition charges must be consistent across similarly situated trainees and require NIH approval if for postdoctoral courses.  \n- The institutional allowance supports additional training-related costs and is managed by the institution.  \n\nThese policies ensure that tuition and fees are covered in a structured and consistent manner, with clear limits and conditions for both predoctoral and postdoctoral NIH fellowships.\n\n**References:**  \n- Individual Fellowship Tuition and Fees: Documents 2, 4, 7, 9 (Sections 11.2.9.5, 11.3.8.3)  \n- Pre-Award Costs Restrictions: Documents 1, 6 (Section 11.2.9.1)  \n- Institutional Allowance and Health Insurance: Documents 5, 10 (Section 11.2.9.4)"}
