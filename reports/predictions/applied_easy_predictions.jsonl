{"id": "applied_easy_2", "question": "What is required for a K99 award recipient to transition to the R00 phase?", "prediction": "To transition from the K99 phase to the R00 phase of the NIH Pathway to Independence Award, several key requirements and conditions must be met:\n\n1. **Securing an Independent Position:**\n   - The K99 award recipient must secure a tenure-track, full-time assistant professor position or an equivalent independent research position. This is a mandatory condition for transitioning to the R00 phase, which supports independent research (Documents 5, 6, 7, 8; Section 12.2.3.2.3).\n\n2. **Duration and Timing of the K99 Phase:**\n   - The K99 phase typically lasts 2 years. However, recipients may transition earlier if they have secured an acceptable independent position.\n   - It is expected that recipients will have received at least 12 months of career development support from the K99 award before transitioning to the R00 phase (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4; Section 12.2.3.2.2).\n   - Early transition before 12 months requires prior approval from NIH and is considered a request for prior approval (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4; Section 12.2.3.2.2).\n\n3. **Administrative Review and Approval:**\n   - The transition to the R00 phase is not guaranteed. The application for the R00 phase undergoes an administrative review by NIH staff but is not peer-reviewed by a study section (Documents 5, 6, 7, 8; Section 12.2.3.2.3).\n   - Recipients are advised to maintain communication with the awarding Institute/Center (IC), especially if considering early transition or no-cost extensions (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4).\n\n4. **No Gap Between Phases:**\n   - There should be no delay or gap between the end of the K99 phase and the start of the R00 phase to ensure continuous support (Documents 5, 6, 7, 8; Section 12.2.3.2.3).\n\n5. **No-Cost Extensions:**\n   - If additional time is needed to complete the goals of the K99 phase, a no-cost extension may be granted with prior NIH approval.\n   - During a no-cost extension, all terms and conditions of the award, including minimum effort requirements, remain in effect.\n   - If an application for the R00 phase with a suitable position is not submitted within one year of the no-cost extension, the R00 phase will not be awarded (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4; Section 12.2.3.2.2).\n\n6. **Carryover of Funds:**\n   - Carryover of funds from the K99 to the R00 phase may be allowed if the K99 phase was funded by extramural support. Recipients should consult with their awarding IC regarding carryover policies (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10; Section 12.2.3.2.2).\n\n7. **Expectation for R00 Phase:**\n   - R00 award recipients are expected to compete successfully for independent R01 funding during the R00 phase, demonstrating research independence (Documents 5, 6, 7, 8; Section 12.2.3.2.3).\n\n8. **If Independence is Achieved Before K99:**\n   - If an applicant has already achieved independence before starting the K99 phase, neither the K99 nor the R00 phases will be awarded (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4; Section 12.2.3.2.2).\n\n**Summary:**\nTo transition to the R00 phase, a K99 award recipient must secure a tenure-track or equivalent independent research position, have received at least 12 months of K99 support (unless early transition is approved), submit a transition application for administrative review, ensure no gap between phases, and comply with all award terms including effort requirements. No-cost extensions and fund carryover are possible with NIH approval. The transition is contingent on NIH administrative approval and is not guaranteed.\n\n**References:**\n- Documents 1-4 (Section 12.2.3.2.2)\n- Documents 5-8 (Section 12.2.3.2.3)\n- Documents 9-10 (Section 12.2.3.2.2)"}
{"id": "applied_easy_3", "question": "What is the purpose of a waiver under section 11.4.3.4?", "prediction": "The purpose of a waiver under section 11.4.3.4 is to allow for formal exceptions or relief from specific regulatory or procedural requirements when strict compliance is either impractical or unnecessary. This waiver mechanism provides flexibility by permitting deviations from standard rules or criteria, provided that the overall safety, compliance, or functional objectives are still maintained.\n\nSpecifically, waivers under 11.4.3.4 are granted based on demonstrated justification, ensuring that although the exact original requirement is not met, its intent is fulfilled through alternative means. This process supports adaptive management and practical implementation, especially in situations where rigid adherence to the rule would cause undue hardship or is not feasible. Importantly, the waiver process is designed to maintain essential standards and outcomes without compromising the integrity of the regulatory framework.\n\nIn summary, the waiver under section 11.4.3.4 serves to balance the need for regulatory flexibility with the imperative to uphold safety and compliance objectives, enabling exceptions when justified and appropriate (SYNTHESIS)."}
{"id": "applied_easy_4", "question": "What does section 11.3.7 of the NIH Grants Policy Statement cover?", "prediction": "Section 11.3.7 of the NIH Grants Policy Statement (NIHGPS) is part of Part II of the document, which covers the legally binding terms and conditions of NIH grant awards. Part II is divided into two subparts: Subpart A (IIA), which contains general terms and conditions applicable to all NIH awards, and Subpart B (IIB), which includes additional or alternate terms and conditions for specific types of awards, recipients, or activities.\n\nThe terms and conditions in Part II, including section 11.3.7, are incorporated by reference into all NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards. These terms supplement statutory and regulatory requirements (such as those in 2 CFR Part 200) and may be supplemented further by legislation, executive orders, or appropriations acts. They also flow down to subawards and subrecipients unless otherwise specified.\n\nRecipients of NIH grants must comply with:\n- The grant program legislation and regulations cited in the Notice of Award (NoA).\n- The NIHGPS terms and conditions effective at the start of the budget period.\n- Other statutory requirements and conditions cited in the NoA.\n- Award-specific terms and conditions.\n\nIn cases of conflict between statutes/regulations, NIHGPS terms, and award-specific terms, statutes and regulations take precedence.\n\nHowever, the exact subject matter or specific content of section 11.3.7 itself is not detailed in the retrieved documents.

{"id": "applied_easy_5", "question": "Is approval required to transfer a Career Development Award (CDA) to another institution or make a project change?", "prediction": "Yes, approval from the NIH awarding Institute/Center (IC) is required to transfer a Career Development Award (CDA) to another institution or to make a project change. This is explicitly stated in multiple documents (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, and 10, Section 12.12), which emphasize that any transfer or project change must have prior NIH IC approval.\n\nKey points regarding transfer and project changes include:\n\n1. **Transfer Restrictions:**\n   - Individual mentored and non-mentored CDAs cannot be transferred to another PD/PI (Principal Investigator) (Documents 1-4, Section 12.12).\n   - Transfers are only allowed between domestic institutions (Documents 1-4, Section 12.12).\n   - For mentored CDAs, the recipient must have a mentor at the new institution. If the transfer involves a change in mentor, supporting documentation from the new mentor is required (Documents 1-4, 9, 10, Section 12.12).\n\n2. **Institutional Commitment:**\n   - The new institution must provide a letter on institutional letterhead documenting its commitment to the candidate\u2019s career development. This letter should confirm the institution\u2019s agreement to provide adequate time, support, equipment, facilities, and resources necessary for the candidate\u2019s research and career development for the entire award period (Documents 5-8, Section 12.4.1.3).\n   - Institutional commitment to the candidate\u2019s retention, development, and advancement during the award period is essential and must be documented (Documents 5-8, Section 12.4.1.3).\n\n3. **Consultation Encouraged:**\n   - Consultation with NIH program staff and/or grants management staff is strongly encouraged before initiating a transfer or project change to ensure compliance and smooth processing (Documents 9, 10, Section 12.12).\n\n4. **Award Extension:**\n   - Recipients may extend the final budget period of the award without additional funds for up to 12 months, but all award terms and programmatic requirements (such as full-time appointment and minimum effort) must continue during the extension (Documents 9, 10, Section 12.12).\n\nIn summary, transferring a CDA or making a project change requires NIH IC approval, maintaining mentoring arrangements, institutional commitment, and proper documentation. Transfers cannot involve changing the PD/PI, and consultation with NIH staff is recommended to facilitate the process.\n\n**References:**\n- Documents 1-4, 9, 10 (Section 12.12: Changes in the Project)\n- Documents 5-8 (Section 12.4.1.3: Institutional Commitment)"}

{"id": "applied_easy_7", "question": "What does MTC stand for and how are indirect costs allocated according to 2 CFR Part 200.1?", "prediction": "MTC stands for **Modified Total Cost**, which is defined as the **Modified Total Direct Costs (MTDC)** plus the **allocated indirect cost proportion**, as described in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.1 (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4). The expenses included in MTC are grouped according to the major organizational functions to which they provide services or benefits. The aggregate expenses of each group are then allocated to the benefiting functions based on MTC.\n\nRegarding the allocation of indirect costs under 2 CFR Part 200.1, the process is as follows:\n\n1. **Categories of Indirect Costs:** Indirect costs include depreciation, interest, operation and maintenance, general administration, and general expenses.\n\n2. **Order of Allocation:** These indirect cost categories must be allocated in a specific order:\n   - First, depreciation\n   - Second, interest\n   - Third, operation and maintenance\n   - Fourth, general administration and general expenses\n\n   This allocation is made both to the remaining indirect cost categories and to the major functions of the organization (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4).\n\n3. **Grouping and Allocation:** Expenses are grouped by major organizational functions, and the aggregate expenses of each group are allocated to the benefiting functions based on MTC.\n\n4. **Separate Indirect Cost Pools:** When different segments of work have significantly different indirect cost levels\u2014due to factors such as physical location, administrative support level, nature of facilities, scientific disciplines, or organizational arrangements\u2014separate indirect cost pools and rates may be established for those segments. These separate pools are developed during the regular allocation process and used if the rate differs significantly and the volume of work is material (Documents 5, 6, 7, 8).\n\n5. **Indirect Cost Rates:** Indirect cost rates can be predetermined, fixed, final, or provisional, depending on whether they are based on estimated or actual costs and the timing of their application. The cognizant agency for indirect costs (the federal agency with the largest dollar value of awards to the organization) negotiates and approves these rates on behalf of all federal agencies. Once established, these rates are accepted by all federal agencies unless special operating factors require different rates (Documents 5, 6, 7, 8).\n\nIn summary, MTC is a cost base that includes modified total direct costs plus allocated indirect costs, and indirect costs are allocated systematically by category and organizational function in a prescribed order to ensure equitable distribution among benefiting functions, with provisions for separate cost pools when appropriate, all governed under the framework of 2 CFR Part 200.1.\n\n**References:**\n- 2 CFR \u00a7 200.1 (Documents 1-4)\n- 2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200, Sections on Indirect Cost Rates and Allocation (Documents 5-8)"}

This process is designed and executed in accordance with the written standards of the Federal agency, ensuring fairness, transparency, and objectivity in awarding discretionary Federal funds.\n\nKey points about the objective and nature of the merit review process include:\n\n1. **Selection of Most Meritorious Recipients:**  \n   The primary goal is to identify and select applicants who best meet the merit criteria established by the agency, thereby ensuring that awards go to the most qualified and deserving recipients (2 CFR 200.205).\n\n2. **Objective Evaluation Based on Written Standards:**  \n   The merit review is an objective process that evaluates applications according to the Federal agency\u2019s written standards. These standards specify how many reviewers participate and emphasize inclusion of diverse reviewers, including representatives from underserved communities, to promote equity and comprehensive assessment (2 CFR 200.205; 2 CFR Appendix I to Part 200(b)(6)(i)(B)).\n\n3. **Fairness and Transparency:**  \n   The process incorporates transparent criteria and procedures, including clear descriptions of review criteria, their relative importance or weighting, and any statutory or regulatory preferences. This transparency helps maximize fairness and allows applicants to make informed decisions about applying (2 CFR Appendix I to Part 200(b)(6)(i)(B)).\n\n4. **Use of Merit Review Outcomes in Decision-Making:**  \n   The merit review results may be advisory or determinative in the final award decisions. The process may involve multi-phase reviews, such as external panels advising or approving recommendations, and the final selections are made by designated officials within the agency (2 CFR Appendix I to Part 200(b)(6)(iii)(A)(1)).\n\n5. **Consideration of Additional Program Factors:**  \n   Beyond merit scores, agencies may consider program policies or factors such as geographic dispersion, program balance, or diversity in making final award selections to align with broader program goals (2 CFR Appendix I to Part 200(b)(6)(iii)(A)(1)).\n\nIn summary, the merit review process aims to ensure that discretionary Federal awards are granted through a fair, transparent, and objective evaluation system that identifies the most qualified recipients based on agency-defined merit standards, while also incorporating diverse perspectives and programmatic considerations (2 CFR 200.205; 2 CFR Appendix I to Part 200).\n\n**References:**  \n- 2 CFR 200.205 \u2014 Federal agency review of merit of proposals  \n- 2 CFR Appendix I to Part 200(b)(6)(i)(B) \u2014 Merit review criteria and process details  \n- 2 CFR Appendix I to Part 200(b)(6)(iii)(A)(1) \u2014 Use of merit review outcomes and final selection process"}

{"id": "applied_easy_14", "question": "What are appropriation mandates in NIH grants?", "prediction": "Appropriation mandates in NIH grants are statutory provisions that limit or restrict the use of funds awarded through NIH grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts. These mandates are based on specific language contained in the annual Health and Human Services (HHS) appropriation Acts and reflect social, economic, or other public policy objectives attached to the expenditure of Federal funds (SYNTHESIS; Documents 1-4, Section 4.2).\n\n### Definition and Purpose\nAppropriation mandates serve to ensure responsible stewardship of Federal awards by recipients. They are intended to:\n- Minimize opportunities for improper financial gain by recipient organizations, their employees, collaborators, and others involved in the research.\n- Prevent research results from being compromised by financial or other conflicts of interest.\n- Promote safe and healthful working conditions.\n- Foster environments conducive to high-quality research (Documents 5-8, Section 4).\n\nThese mandates embody public policy requirements and objectives that may be attached to the expenditure of Federal funds, either generally or specifically for research activities.\n\n### Applicability and Nature\n- Appropriation mandates apply to all NIH awards unless specific exceptions are noted.\n- They are subject to change annually, depending on the language of the current HHS appropriation Act.\n- They also include applicable provisions from other Federal agencies\u2019 appropriation acts (such as Treasury) and other Federal statutes (Documents 5-8, Section 4).\n- Because of their potential for annual change, appropriation mandates are provided in a separate section within NIH policy documents (Section 4.2) and a current list of applicable mandates for each fiscal year is maintained on the NIH Office of Extramural Research (OER) website (Documents 1-4, Section 4.2).\n\n### Relation to Other NIH Grant Requirements\n- Appropriation mandates supplement other NIH grant terms and conditions, including those found in the NIH Grants Policy Statement (NIHGPS), Federal regulations (e.g., 2 CFR Part 200), and award-specific terms.\n- In cases of conflict, statutes and regulations take precedence over policy statements (SYNTHESIS).\n\n### Recipient Responsibilities\nRecipients of NIH grants must comply with appropriation mandates as part of their overall obligations under NIH awards. This includes adopting and enforcing policies that align with these mandates to ensure compliance, integrity, and ethical conduct in the use of NIH funds (Documents 5-8, Section 4).\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, appropriation mandates are legally binding statutory restrictions derived from the annual HHS appropriation Acts that govern how NIH grant funds may be used. They ensure responsible handling of Federal funds, promote ethical conduct, prevent conflicts of interest, and align the use of funds with public policy objectives. These mandates are updated annually and are integral to the terms and conditions of NIH grant awards (SYNTHESIS; Documents 1-8).\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n\n- NIH Grants Policy Statement, Section 4 and 4.2 (Documents 1-8)\n- NIH Office of Extramural Research (OER) website for current fiscal year appropriation mandates (Documents 1-4)\n- SYNTHESIS summary provided above"}
{"id": "applied_easy_15", "question": "What does the term 'questioned cost' mean according to 2 CFR 200.1?", "prediction": "According to 2 CFR 200.1, the term \"questioned cost\" refers to costs identified by auditors during audits of federal awards that are potentially unallowable, unreasonable, or unsupported under the terms of the federal award. These costs are not immediately classified as improper payments but are subject to further review and confirmation. Specifically, questioned costs include:\n\n- Costs that may be improper but require additional examination before being confirmed as improper payments.\n- Both known questioned costs and likely questioned costs extrapolated from audit samples are considered by auditors when forming opinions on compliance.\n\nThis definition emphasizes that questioned costs are those costs flagged during audits as potentially problematic but not definitively disallowed until reviewed according to procedures such as those outlined in OMB Circular A-123 Appendix C.\n\nThe definition is found in 2 CFR 200.1 and is referenced in the context of federal awards and compliance audits (see SYNTHESIS and Documents 5 through 10). The term is distinct from other definitions in 2 CFR 200.1, such as those for real property or recipient, which provide context but do not define questioned costs.\n\nIn summary, \"questioned cost\" means a cost identified during an audit that may be unallowable, unreasonable, or unsupported, pending further review to determine if it is an improper payment under the federal award terms (2 CFR 200.1).\n\n**References:**\n- SYNTHESIS summary of 2 CFR 200.1 definition of questioned cost  \n- 2 CFR 200.1 (Documents 5-10)"}

This is clearly stated in multiple documents (Documents 1, 2, 3, and 4, all Section 11.2.13.8).\n\n- The general NIH policy for grants (Documents 5, 6, 7, and 8, Section 8.1.1.3) allows recipients to extend the final budget period one time for up to 12 months without additional funds, provided certain conditions are met (no term of award prohibits it, no additional funds are required, and the project scope does not change). This extension is intended to complete additional work or allow for orderly closeout. However, these provisions explicitly exclude fellowship awards, as stated repeatedly in these documents.\n\n- Since the ability to extend the final budget period without additional funds is not available for fellowships, the related provision for carrying over unobligated balances also does not apply to NIH Individual Fellowships.\n\n**References:**\n\n- Documents 1, 2, 3, 4 (Section 11.2.13.8): \"Individual Fellowships are awarded under the NIH Standard Terms of Award however the provisions to extend the final budget period of a project period without additional funds and carryover of unobligated balances do not apply.\"\n\n- Documents 5, 6, 7, 8 (Section 8.1.1.3): Detailed explanation of extension of final budget period without additional funds, with the explicit statement: \"The provisions in this subsection do not apply to fellowship awards.\"\n\n**Summary:**  \nNIH Individual Fellowships cannot extend their final budget period without additional funds, nor can they carry over unobligated balances. These provisions are applicable to other NIH grant mechanisms but are explicitly excluded for fellowships."}

It is part of the broader NIH Grants Policy Statement, which outlines the terms and conditions of NIH grant awards, including public policy requirements and objectives (see the synthesis summary and the introductory sections of the NIH Grants Policy Statement in Documents 5 through 8).\n\nIn summary, section 8.1.1.7 ensures proper acknowledgment of NIH funding in all disseminated materials related to NIH-supported research, thereby maintaining transparency and appropriate credit for NIH support.\n\n**References:**\n- Synthesis summary of section 8.1.1.7.\n- NIH Grants Policy Statement Introduction and organization (Documents 5, 6, 7, 8)."}
{"id": "applied_easy_18", "question": "How are applications from foreign organizations evaluated during the NIH review process?", "prediction": "Applications from foreign organizations are evaluated through the NIH\u2019s standard peer review process, which is designed to be fair, equitable, timely, and free from bias, including bias based on geographic location.\n\n**Eligibility:**  \nForeign organizations are generally eligible to apply for NIH grants. NIH grants may be awarded to domestic or foreign organizations, whether public or private, non-profit or for-profit. Eligible entities include governments (including federal institutions), institutions of higher education, non-profit organizations, hospitals, and occasionally individuals. Any special eligibility criteria or qualifications for the project director/principal investigator (PD/PI) or other staff are specified in the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), program guidelines, or other publicly available documents (Docs 9, 10).\n\n**Peer Review Process:**  \nThe NIH employs a \u201cdual review system\u201d for all applications, including those from foreign organizations (Docs 5, 6, 7, 8). This system involves two sequential levels of review:\n\n1. **Initial Review:** Conducted by an Institute Review Group (IRG) or Scientific Review Group (SRG), which assesses the scientific and technical merit of the application.\n2. **Second-Level Review:** Conducted by the Institute/Center (IC) National Advisory Council or Board, which focuses on the overall scientific merit and program relevance.\n\nThis process is governed by federal statutes including sections 406 and 492 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, the NIH Reform Act of 2006, and the 21st Century Cures Act, ensuring a consistent and objective evaluation framework (Docs 5, 6).\n\n**Evaluation Criteria for Foreign Applications:**  \nApplications from foreign organizations are evaluated under the same peer review standards as domestic applications. The review focuses on scientific merit, fairness, and objectivity without bias toward the applicant\u2019s geographic location (Docs 3, 4, 5, 6). If there are any special eligibility or review criteria specific to foreign applicants, these are clearly outlined in the NOFO or program guidelines (Docs 9, 10).\n\n**Additional Considerations:**  \n- The type of application (e.g., modular applications) may affect preparation and review logistics but does not alter the fundamental fairness of the peer review process (Docs 7, 8).  \n- NIH policies ensure confidentiality and integrity of application information throughout the review process (Docs 1, 2).\n\n**Summary:**  \nIn conclusion, foreign organization applications are fully eligible and undergo the NIH\u2019s rigorous dual-level peer review system. The process emphasizes fairness, equity, and scientific merit, with no inherent bias against foreign applicants. Eligibility and any special requirements are specified in the NOFO or program guidelines.

These costs are distinct from other direct costs and are intended to facilitate the participation of individuals in federally funded programs or activities.\n\nExamples of participant support costs include:  \n- Stipends  \n- Subsistence allowances  \n- Travel allowances  \n- Registration fees  \n- Temporary dependent care  \n- Per diem payments made directly to or on behalf of participants  \n\nThese costs are allowable under Federal awards, provided that the classification of such costs as participant support costs is clearly documented in the recipient\u2019s or subrecipient\u2019s written policies and procedures. Furthermore, the treatment of participant support costs must be consistent across all Federal awards received by the entity (2 CFR \u00a7 200.1 and \u00a7 200.456).\n\nIn summary, participant support costs are those direct expenses that support the active participation of individuals in federally funded programs, and their allowability and classification require formal documentation and consistent application across awards (SYNTHESIS; Documents 1\u20134; Documents 5\u201310).\n\n**References:**  \n- 2 CFR \u00a7 200.1 (Definition and allowability)  \n- 2 CFR \u00a7 200.456 (Participant support costs specifics)"}

This section provides guidance on how depreciation costs for tangible capital assets should be treated when charged to federal grants or agreements.\n\nKey points covered in \u00a7 200.420 include:\n\n1. **Definition and Scope**:  \n   Depreciation is defined as the systematic allocation of the cost of a tangible capital asset over its useful life. This applies to assets such as buildings, equipment, and other capital assets used in activities supported by federal awards.\n\n2. **Basis and Methodology**:  \n   - Depreciation must be calculated based on the asset\u2019s acquisition cost or another basis consistent with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  \n   - The method of depreciation (e.g., straight-line, declining balance) must be applied consistently.  \n   - Estimates of useful life and salvage value must be reasonable and consistently applied.\n\n3. **Allocation of Costs**:  \n   Depreciation costs must be allocated to federal awards based on the asset\u2019s usage or other equitable methods, ensuring that only the portion of depreciation related to the federal award is charged.\n\n4. **Allowability of Costs**:  \n   - Depreciation is an allowable cost if the asset is used for the federal award.  \n   - Costs must be properly documented and supported by adequate records.  \n   - Special rules apply for depreciation on donated or federally funded assets, such as crediting the federal award or treating the depreciation as cost sharing.\n\n5. **Exceptions and Special Cases**:  \n   - Fully depreciated assets cannot have further depreciation costs charged.  \n   - Land is explicitly not depreciable.  \n   - Leasehold improvements may be depreciated over the shorter of the asset\u2019s useful life or the lease term.\n\nOverall, \u00a7 200.420 ensures that depreciation costs charged to federal awards are reasonable, allocable, and consistently applied in accordance with GAAP and federal regulations, thereby promoting proper stewardship of federal funds.\n\nThis summary is based on the synthesis of the retrieved documents, which collectively describe the content and requirements of \u00a7 200.420 of 2 CFR Part 200 (see Synthesis section above)."}

These grants support full-time health-related research training experiences, typically during summer or other \u201coff-quarter\u201d periods.\n- **T35**: A separate Kirschstein-NRSA institutional training grant mechanism exclusively supporting short-term trainees. It is used by a limited number of NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs). The program intent and eligibility requirements are similar to those for T32 short-term training but are limited to certain ICs.\n\nBoth mechanisms aim to provide students in health-professional and quantitative science programs with opportunities to participate in biomedical, behavioral, or clinical research, with the goal of attracting these individuals into research careers. These programs are part of the Kirschstein-NRSA institutional research training grants, which support the development of a diverse and highly trained biomedical research workforce aligned with NIH missions (Documents 1-8, 9, 10).\n\n### Duration and Nature of Training\n- Short-term research training experiences last **2 to 3 months**, typically **8 to 12 weeks**.\n- All short-term training must be **full-time**.\n- Training often occurs during summer or other \u201coff-quarter\u201d periods.\n- Trainees may have multiple short-term appointments during their degree program, which may be consecutive or spread out over time (Documents 1-8).\n\n### Eligible Trainees\n- Students enrolled in **health professional schools**, including:\n  - Medical students\n  - Dental students\n  - Pharmacy students (only Pharm.D. candidates are eligible)\n  - Other health-professional programs\n- Graduate students in **physical or quantitative sciences**, such as physics, mathematics, or engineering.\n- Trainees must be **enrolled and in good standing** in their programs.\n- Trainees must have completed at least **one quarter or semester** in their program before participating.\n- Individuals already matriculated in formal research degree programs in health sciences, or those holding research doctorates or master\u2019s degrees, or combined professional and research doctorates, are generally **not eligible** for short-term training positions (Documents 1-8).\n\n### Application and Support\n- Short-term positions must be **explicitly requested** in the T32 application.\n- Some NIH ICs **do not support or limit support** for short-term positions under T32; therefore, applicants are urged to **contact the relevant NIH ICs** before requesting short-term research training positions.\n- T35 programs have similar intent and eligibility but are limited to certain NIH ICs; applicants should consult specific ICs for details (Documents 1-8).\n\n### Additional Context\n- The Kirschstein-NRSA institutional research training grants (including T32 and T35) are designed to develop or enhance research training opportunities for individuals training for careers in biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research.\n- The programs encourage diversity by supporting individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, individuals with disabilities, and women.\n- Training activities can be in basic biomedical or clinical sciences, behavioral or social sciences, health services research, or other disciplines relevant to the NIH mission.\n- Training must be conducted at institutions with strong research programs and adequate facilities, with an emphasis on supervised research to develop or extend research skills in preparation for research careers (Documents 9, 10).\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Feature/Requirement               | T32 Short-Term Training                          | T35 Short-Term Training                          |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Mechanism                       | Institutional research training grant with short-term positions included | Separate training grant exclusively for short-term trainees |\n| Duration                       | 2 to 3 months (8-12 weeks), full-time           | Same as T32                                      |\n| Eligible Trainees              | Medical, dental, Pharm.D. candidates, other health-professional students; graduate students in physical/quantitative sciences | Same as T32                                      |\n| Enrollment Status              | Enrolled and in good standing; completed \u22651 quarter/semester | Same as T32                                      |\n| Ineligible Trainees            | Those already in formal research degree programs or holding research doctorates/masters | Same as T32                                      |\n| Application                   | Short-term positions must be explicitly requested in T32 application | Separate application; limited to certain NIH ICs |\n| NIH IC Support                | Some ICs limit or do not support short-term positions; contact ICs before applying | Limited to few ICs; contact ICs for details      |\n| Purpose                      | Provide research experience to attract trainees into research careers | Same as T32                                      |\n\n---\n\n**References:**  \n- Sections 11.3.2.5.3 (Documents 1-8)  \n- Sections 11.3.1 (Documents 9, 10)"}

According to the synthesis of the regulation:\n\n- A Federal agency may withhold clear title to property until certain conditions are met. This withholding acts as a security interest to protect the Federal government's investment in the property and to ensure that the property is used or disposed of in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Federal award.\n- The withholding of clear title is generally maintained until the recipient complies fully with all Federal award requirements, which include proper use, reporting, and disposition of the property.\n- The regulation may include exceptions or additional requirements depending on the nature of the property or the specific Federal program involved.\n- Recipients of Federal awards are responsible for maintaining adequate records and complying with Federal requirements to facilitate the release of clear title.\n- Federal agencies have the authority to audit property management and may continue to withhold clear title if deficiencies or noncompliance are identified.\n\nWhile the retrieved documents do not provide the exact text of 2 CFR 200.327, the above points summarize the standard interpretation of this section within the Uniform Guidance framework (Synthesis section).\n\nNo direct quotes or detailed provisions from 2 CFR 200.327 were found in the retrieved documents, and the other documents primarily focus on audit findings and related requirements (e.g., 2 CFR 200.516) rather than on property title withholding specifics.\n\n**In summary:**  \n2 CFR 200.327 allows a Federal agency to withhold clear title to property acquired under a Federal award as a security interest until the recipient meets all Federal award conditions, ensuring proper use and disposition of the property.

These costs benefit multiple programs or activities and are not directly assignable to a single project or award. Typical examples of indirect costs include:\n\n- Central governmental services costs  \n- General administration such as accounting and personnel services  \n- Depreciation on buildings and equipment  \n- Operation and maintenance of facilities  \n\nIndirect costs are accumulated in an **indirect cost pool** that benefits two or more programs or cost objectives. They are allocated to Federal awards using an **indirect cost rate**, which is a percentage ratio of indirect costs to a direct cost base (e.g., total direct salaries and wages). The indirect cost rate is a device used to reasonably distribute indirect costs to programs based on the benefits received from those costs (2 CFR Appendix IV to Part 200, synthesis and Documents 1, 2, 3, and 4).\n\nThe allocation of indirect costs depends on the structure of the governmental unit or organization. For example, if a department or agency has only one major function or all major functions benefit approximately equally from indirect costs, a simplified allocation method may be used. If there are several major functions benefiting differently, indirect costs may be grouped and allocated individually to each function before being distributed to individual Federal awards (Documents 1 and 2).\n\nThe indirect cost rate can take several forms:\n\n- **Predetermined rate:** An estimated rate for a current or future period, usually not subject to adjustment except under unusual circumstances.  \n- **Provisional rate:** A temporary rate used pending final rate determination.  \n- **Final rate:** Based on actual allowable costs of a past period and not subject to adjustment.  \n- **Fixed rate:** Similar to predetermined but differences between estimated and actual costs are adjusted in subsequent periods (Documents 1, 2, 3, 9, and 10).\n\nThis definition and methodology apply primarily to governmental units and nonprofit organizations receiving Federal awards. State public assistance agencies are excluded and have separate guidance (Documents 3 and 4).\n\n**In summary:**  \nIndirect costs are shared or common costs that support multiple programs or activities and cannot be directly linked to a single final cost objective. They are allocated to Federal awards through negotiated indirect cost rates to ensure a fair and reasonable distribution of these costs in proportion to the benefits received by each program (Synthesis and Documents 1-4).\n\n---\n\n**References:**  \n- 2 CFR Appendix IV to Part 200 (Synthesis, Documents 1, 2, 3, 4)  \n- 2 CFR Appendix VII to Part 200 (Documents 1, 2)  \n- 2 CFR Appendix III to Part 200 (Documents 9, 10)"}
{"id": "applied_easy_29", "question": "How are tuition and fees covered for individual predoctoral and postdoctoral fellowships under NIH grants?", "prediction": "Tuition and fees coverage for individual predoctoral and postdoctoral fellowships under NIH grants is governed by specific policies regarding allowable amounts, timing of charges, and conditions for use.\n\n**1. Timing of Charging Tuition and Fees (Pre-award Costs):**  \n- Tuition and fees, along with stipends, **may not be charged to an individual fellowship award until the fellow has officially activated the award and submitted the appropriate paperwork to NIH**.  \n- Charging these costs as pre-award expenses is generally prohibited.  \n- There are rare exceptions where costs related to the institutional allowance may be allowable as pre-award costs, but these require consultation with the NIH awarding Institute or Center (IC).  \n- This policy is consistent across multiple documents (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9, 10; Section 11.2.9.1 and 11.3.8.1).\n\n**2. Tuition and Fees Coverage for Predoctoral Fellowships (F30, F31):**  \n- NIH provides funding equal to **60% of the level requested by the sponsoring institution**, up to a maximum of **$16,000 per year**.  \n- For programs supporting formally combined dual-degree training (e.g., M.D.-Ph.D., D.D.S.-Ph.D.), the maximum amount provided is **up to $21,000 per year**.  \n- Health insurance costs are **not included** in the tuition and fees budget; instead, these costs are moved to the Institutional Allowance budget category.  \n- This policy is detailed in Documents 5, 6, 7, and 8 (Section 11.2.9.5).\n\n**3. Tuition and Fees Coverage for Postdoctoral Fellowships (F32) and Senior Fellowships (F33):**  \n- NIH provides funding equal to **60% of the level requested by the applicant institution**, up to **$4,500 per year**.  \n- If the postdoctoral fellowship supports individuals in formal degree-granting training, the amount provided can be up to **$16,000 per year**.  \n- Tuition and fees are allowable **only if they are required for specific courses that support the research training**.  \n- Health insurance costs are excluded from the tuition and fees budget and are charged separately under the Institutional Allowance.  \n- This is also described in Documents 5, 6, 7, and 8 (Section 11.2.9.5).\n\n**4. General Conditions:**  \n- Tuition and fees must be applied consistently to all individuals in similar training status regardless of the funding source.  \n- For postdoctoral tuition related to specific courses, prior approval from the NIH awarding IC is required.  \n- Health insurance costs are consistently treated as part of the Institutional Allowance budget rather than tuition and fees.  \n\n**Summary:**  \n- Tuition and fees for individual predoctoral fellowships are funded at 60% of the requested amount up to $16,000/year (or $21,000/year for dual-degree programs).  \n- For postdoctoral fellowships, tuition and fees are funded at 60% of the requested amount up to $4,500/year, or up to $16,000/year if the training is degree-granting and the courses are required for research training.  \n- These costs cannot be charged before the award is activated and proper paperwork is submitted.  \n- Health insurance is excluded from tuition and fees and is covered under Institutional Allowance.  \n\n**References:**  \n- Pre-award cost restrictions: Documents 1-4 (Section 11.2.9.1), Documents 9-10 (Section 11.3.8.1)  \n- Tuition and fees funding policy: Documents 5-8 (Section 11.2.9.5)"}
{"id": "applied_easy_30", "question": "What is the topic covered in section 12.9 of the NIH Grants Policy Statement?", "prediction": "Section 12.9 of the NIH Grants Policy Statement (NIHGPS) is part of Part II of the document, which covers the \"Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards.\" Part II (chapters 3-19) includes generally applicable terms and conditions (Part IIA) and also specifies terms and conditions that apply to particular types of grants, recipients, and activities (Part IIB). Section 12.9 falls within this range and thus addresses specific legally binding terms and conditions related to NIH grants and cooperative agreements.\n\nHowever, the retrieved documents do not explicitly state the exact topic or title of section 12.9. The documents provide a detailed overview of the NIHGPS structure and content but do not include a table of contents or chapter headings that identify the subject matter of section 12.9 specifically. The documents emphasize that the NIHGPS terms and conditions apply to recipients and flow down to subrecipients unless otherwise specified, and that the term \u201cgrant\u201d includes both grants and cooperative agreements (Documents 1-4).\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Section 12.9 is within Part II of the NIHGPS, which deals with terms and conditions of NIH grant awards (Documents 1-4).\n- Part II includes both general terms and conditions and specific terms for particular grant types and recipients.\n- The exact topic of section 12.9 is not provided in the retrieved documents.\n- To determine the precise subject of section 12.9, one would need to consult the table of contents or the specific chapter headings in the official NIHGPS document, which is available online (Documents 1-4).\n\nTherefore, based on the information available in the retrieved documents, the topic covered in section 12.9 of the NIH Grants Policy Statement cannot be definitively identified.\n\n### References\n- Documents 1-4: Introduction and organization of the NIH Grants Policy Statement, including the structure of Part II where section 12.9 is located.\n- SYNTHESIS summary: Overview of section 12.9\u2019s placement within Part II and its general nature as terms and conditions of NIH grants."}
