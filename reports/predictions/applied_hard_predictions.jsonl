{"id": "applied_hard_1", "question": "According to NIH grant policies, what administrative requirements must a K99 award recipient fulfill to transition to the R00 phase without delay, and under what circumstances can a waiver be granted for these requirements?", "prediction": "According to NIH grant policies for the K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award, the administrative requirements and conditions for a K99 award recipient to transition to the R00 phase without delay, as well as the circumstances under which waivers may be granted, are as follows:\n\n### Administrative Requirements to Transition to the R00 Phase Without Delay\n\n1. **Securing an Acceptable Independent Position:**\n   - The K99 award recipient must secure a tenure-track, full-time assistant professor position or an equivalent independent research position to be eligible to transition to the R00 phase. Transition to the R00 phase is contingent upon obtaining such a position and is not guaranteed (Documents 5, 6, 7, 8; Section 12.2.3.2.3).\n   \n2. **Minimum Duration of K99 Phase:**\n   - It is expected that recipients will have received at least 12 months of mentored career development support under the K99 phase before transitioning to the R00 phase (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10; Section 12.2.3.2.2 and 12.2.3.2.1).\n   \n3. **Submission of Transition Application:**\n   - The recipient must submit a transition application for the R00 phase, which undergoes administrative review by NIH staff (not peer review). This application must demonstrate the secured independent position (Documents 5, 6, 7, 8; Section 12.2.3.2.3).\n   \n4. **No Delay Between Phases:**\n   - There should be no gap or delay between the end of the K99 phase and the start of the R00 phase to ensure continuous support (Documents 5, 6, 7, 8; Section 12.2.3.2.3).\n   \n5. **Prior Approval for Early Transition:**\n   - If the recipient wishes to transition earlier than the typical 2-year K99 phase (but after at least 12 months), this early transition requires prior NIH approval as a formal \"Request for Prior Approval\" (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4; Section 12.2.3.2.2).\n   \n6. **No-Cost Extensions:**\n   - If additional time is needed to complete the K99 phase goals, a no-cost extension may be requested but requires prior NIH approval. During such extensions, all award terms, including minimum effort requirements, remain in effect (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4; Section 12.2.3.2.2).\n   - If the recipient does not submit an R00 application with a suitable position within one year of the no-cost extension, the R00 phase will not be awarded (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4; Section 12.2.3.2.2).\n   \n7. **Carryover of Funds:**\n   - Carryover of funds from the K99 to the R00 phase may be allowed if the K99 phase was extramurally funded, but recipients should consult the awarding Institute or Center (IC) for specific policies (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4; Section 12.2.3.2.2).\n\n### Circumstances Under Which Waivers or Extensions May Be Granted\n\n1. **Extension of K99 Eligibility Window:**\n   - NIH may consider requests to extend the K99 eligibility window beyond the standard 4 years of postdoctoral research training for reasons such as medical concerns, disability, family care responsibilities, extended clinical training, natural disasters, and active military service. Each request is reviewed on a case-by-case basis (Documents 9, 10; Section 12.2.3.2.1).\n   - A one-year extension is automatically approved for childbirth within the 4-year eligibility window, provided the applicant submits the child's date of birth and justification at least 12 weeks before application submission (Documents 9, 10; Section 12.2.3.2.1).\n   \n2. **Waivers for Aggregate Support Limits or Other Requirements:**\n   - NIH may grant waivers for aggregate support limits or other program requirements based on appropriate justification and institutional endorsement submitted by the Authorized Organizational Representative (AOR) (Synthesis).\n   \n3. **Prior Approval for Early Transition or No-Cost Extensions:**\n   - Early transition to the R00 phase or requests for no-cost extensions require prior NIH approval, which can be considered a form of waiver or exception to the standard timing rules (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4; Section 12.2.3.2.2).\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- If an applicant achieves independence before starting the K99 phase, neither the K99 nor the R00 phase will be awarded (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10).\n- NIH intramural scientists may apply; their K99 phase is supported intramurally, and the R00 phase is supported extramurally after securing an independent position (Documents 9, 10).\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nTo transition to the R00 phase without delay, a K99 award recipient must:\n\n- Secure a tenure-track or equivalent independent position.\n- Complete at least 12 months of K99 career development support.\n- Submit a transition application for administrative NIH review.\n- Ensure no gap between K99 and R00 phases.\n- Obtain NIH prior approval for any early transition or no-cost extension.\n\nWaivers or extensions may be granted for eligibility timing or support limits based on justified requests reviewed on a case-by-case basis, including for medical, family, or other significant life events, with institutional endorsement.\n\n---\n\n**References:**  \n- NIH Grants Policy Statement, Sections 12.2.3.2.1, 12.2.3.2.2, 12.2.3.2.3 (Documents 1-10)  \n- Synthesis summary provided above"}

This approval is mandatory for any transfer or project change (Documents 5, 6, 7, 8; Section 12.12).\n\n   - **Mentor Requirement at New Institution:**  \n     For mentored CDAs, the recipient must have a mentor at the new institution. If the transfer involves a change in mentor, supporting documentation from the new mentor is required to demonstrate the mentoring relationship (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8; Section 12.12).\n\n   - **Consultation with NIH Staff:**  \n     It is strongly encouraged that the recipient consult with NIH program staff and/or grants management staff before initiating the transfer to ensure compliance with policies and smooth processing (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4; Section 12.12).\n\n   - **Change of Recipient Organization Policies:**  \n     The transfer process follows the NIH Change of Recipient Organization policies applicable to domestic institutions (Documents 5, 6, 7, 8; Section 12.12).\n\n   - **Award Remains with Original Recipient:**  \n     The award cannot be transferred to another PD/PI; it remains with the original recipient even after the transfer (Documents 5, 6, 7, 8; Section 12.12).\n\n2. **Initiation of Support at the New Institution:**\n\n   - Support at the new institution begins only after NIH approval of the transfer is granted. The recipient cannot start using the award funds at the new institution until this approval is in place (SYNTHESIS).\n\n3. **Salary and Effort Requirements During Approved Extension Without Additional Funds:**\n\n   - **Extension of Final Budget Period:**  \n     Recipients have the authority to extend the final budget period of the project for up to 12 months without additional funds. This extension is subject to all original terms, conditions, and programmatic requirements continuing to apply (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4; Section 12.12).\n\n   - **Full-Time Appointment and Minimum Effort:**  \n     During any approved extension, the recipient must maintain a full-time appointment and the minimum required effort. Generally, this is 75% full-time professional effort (equivalent to 9 person months) on the CDA (SYNTHESIS; Documents 1, 2, 3, 4; Section 12.12).\n\n   - **Reduced Effort if Independent Support is Obtained:**  \n     If the recipient obtains independent peer-reviewed research support during the final two years of the CDA, the effort on the CDA may be reduced to no less than 50% full-time professional effort (6 person months), provided the total research effort remains at least 75% (9 person months). A letter from the department chair or institutional official must accompany any competing research grant application to confirm continued career development focus, mentor access, and protected research effort (SYNTHESIS).\n\n   - **Salary Support Adjustments:**  \n     NIH will adjust salary support on the CDA consistent with any reduced effort but will continue full support for research development costs (SYNTHESIS).\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- To transfer a mentored CDA to another domestic institution with a change of mentor, the recipient must obtain NIH awarding IC approval, provide supporting documentation from the new mentor, and consult NIH staff before initiating the transfer.  \n- The award remains with the original recipient and support at the new institution begins only after NIH approval.  \n- During any approved no-cost extension of up to 12 months, the recipient must maintain full-time appointment and minimum effort (generally 75%), unless independent research support is obtained allowing reduction to 50% effort on the CDA with total research effort maintained at 75%.  \n- Salary support will be adjusted accordingly, but research development costs remain fully supported.\n\n**References:**  \n- Documents 1-8, Section 12.12 (Changes in the Project)  \n- SYNTHESIS section summarizing key points on transfer, mentor change, extension, and effort requirements"}
{"id": "applied_hard_3", "question": "According to 2 CFR Part 200.1, how should an organization allocate indirect cost categories such as depreciation, interest, operation and maintenance, and general administration expenses to major functions based on Modified Total Direct Costs (MTC), and which NIH office should be contacted for guidance on reporting these allocations as per NIH Grants Policy Statement section 11.3.13?", "prediction": "According to 2 CFR Part 200.1, an organization must allocate indirect cost categories such as **depreciation, interest, operation and maintenance, and general administration expenses** by first grouping these expenses according to the major functions of the organization that they benefit. Then, the aggregate expenses of each group are allocated to the benefitting major functions based on the **Modified Total Direct Costs (MTC)**. The MTC is defined as the modified total direct costs (MTDC) plus the allocated indirect cost proportion (\u00a7 200.1). \n\nThe allocation must follow a specific **order of distribution** for these indirect cost categories:\n1. Depreciation\n2. Interest\n3. Operation and maintenance\n4. General administration and general expenses\n\nThese categories are allocated both to the remaining indirect cost categories and to the major functions of the organization (\u00a7 200.1, Documents 1-4).\n\nFurthermore, indirect costs must be accumulated into separate cost groupings or pools classified broadly as **Facilities** and **Administration**. Each pool is allocated individually to the benefitting functions using an allocation base that best measures the relative benefits provided to each function. The allocation base for these pools is typically the MTC, expressed as a percentage of the distribution base identified with that category (\u00a7 200.414, Documents 5-8).\n\nRegarding NIH grants, these indirect costs are referred to as **Facilities and Administrative (F&A) costs**, which include depreciation, operation and maintenance, and administrative expenses. Organizations must manage and account for these costs consistently and must not include F&A costs as direct costs (NIH Grants Policy Statement (NIHGPS) Section 11.3.13, Documents 9-10).\n\nFor guidance on reporting these indirect cost allocations under NIH grants, organizations should contact the **NIH Office of Policy for Extramural Research Administration (OPERA)** or the designated NIH grants management office responsible for policy interpretation and assistance (NIHGPS Section 11.3.13).\n\n### Summary:\n- **Allocation Method:**  \n  - Group indirect costs by major functions benefiting from them.  \n  - Allocate these grouped costs to major functions based on Modified Total Direct Costs (MTC).  \n  - Follow the order of distribution: depreciation, interest, operation and maintenance, then general administration expenses.  \n  - Accumulate indirect costs into Facilities and Administration pools and allocate each pool individually using an allocation base reflecting relative benefits (usually MTC).\n\n- **NIH Reporting Guidance:**  \n  - Indirect costs are reported as Facilities and Administrative (F&A) costs.  \n  - Contact the **NIH Office of Policy for Extramural Research Administration (OPERA)** or the NIH grants management office for guidance on reporting these allocations (NIHGPS Section 11.3.13).\n\n**References:**  \n- 2 CFR Part 200.1 (Documents 1-4)  \n- 2 CFR \u00a7 200.414 (Documents 5-8)  \n- NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 11.3.13 (Documents 9-10)"}

Furthermore, if the fellowship applicant is from a foreign organization, what additional review criteria must be considered during the application review process, and what approvals are required before funding can be awarded?", "prediction": "Based on the retrieved documents, the management of intra-Institution of Higher Education (IHE) faculty consulting activities that exceed a faculty member's Institutional Base Salary (IBS) under an NIH individual fellowship awarded under NIH Standard Terms of Award, as well as the additional review criteria and approvals required for fellowship applicants from foreign organizations, are as follows:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Management of Intra-IHE Faculty Consulting Activities Exceeding Base Salary under NIH Individual Fellowships\n\n- **General NIH Standard Terms for Individual Fellowships:**\n  - Individual fellowships are awarded under NIH Standard Terms of Award.\n  - Provisions to extend the final budget period without additional funds and carryover of unobligated balances **do not apply** to individual fellowships (Documents 1-4, Section 11.2.13.8).\n  - Budgets are formula-based and generally restricted by category.\n  - Rebudgeting funds requires **prior written approval** from the NIH awarding Institute or Center (IC) (Documents 5-8, Section 11.2.9.9).\n  - Stipends must be used as awarded; no rebudgeting into the stipend category to increase stipend levels is allowed.\n  \n- **Intra-IHE Consulting Activities:**\n  - Intra-IHE consulting by faculty is generally considered part of their faculty obligations and compensated within their Institutional Base Salary (IBS) (Documents 9-10, Section chapter_in IIB).\n  - Additional compensation above IBS for consulting is allowable **only in unusual cases**, specifically when:\n    - The consulting crosses departmental lines or involves a separate or remote operation.\n    - The consulting work is **in addition** to the faculty member\u2019s regular responsibilities.\n  - Such additional compensation must be:\n    - Specifically provided for in the Federal award budget, **or**\n    - Approved in writing by the NIH awarding IC.\n  - Written guidelines must exist at the recipient institution permitting consulting payments.\n  - An individual cannot be paid as both an employee and a consultant under the same NIH grant.\n  - Authorization for consulting fees must be documented in writing by the head of the organization or their designee, ensuring no conflict of interest (Documents 9-10).\n\n- **Implications for Individual Fellowships:**\n  - Since individual fellowships have formula-based budgets with restricted categories and no allowance for carryover or extension without additional funds, any intra-IHE consulting compensation exceeding IBS would require:\n    - Prior written approval from the NIH awarding IC.\n    - Explicit inclusion in the fellowship award budget or a formal approval amendment.\n  - Given the restrictions on rebudgeting and stipend use, it is unlikely that additional consulting compensation could be accommodated without additional funds or explicit NIH approval.\n  - Therefore, intra-IHE faculty consulting activities exceeding base salary under an individual fellowship must be carefully justified, documented, and approved in writing by NIH before such payments can be made.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Additional Review Criteria and Approvals for Fellowship Applicants from Foreign Organizations\n\n- **Additional Review Criteria:**\n  - Applications from foreign organizations require additional review criteria related to:\n    - Eligibility and appropriateness of the foreign institution.\n    - Compliance with NIH policies on foreign awards (SYNTHESIS section).\n  - These criteria ensure that the foreign institution is suitable for the fellowship and that the award aligns with NIH policies governing foreign entities.\n\n- **Approvals Required Before Funding:**\n  - Before funding can be awarded to a foreign fellowship applicant, additional NIH review and approvals are required.\n  - This may include higher-level NIH IC or agency clearances.\n  - Although specific procedural details are not fully detailed in the retrieved documents, it is clear that foreign applications undergo more stringent scrutiny and require explicit NIH approval before funding (SYNTHESIS section).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Intra-IHE Faculty Consulting Exceeding Base Salary:**\n  - Allowed only in unusual cases where consulting is additional to regular duties and crosses departmental or operational boundaries.\n  - Must be specifically budgeted or approved in writing by NIH.\n  - Requires institutional written guidelines and documented authorization by organizational leadership.\n  - No carryover or budget extension provisions apply to individual fellowships, so additional compensation must be pre-approved and budgeted.\n\n- **Foreign Fellowship Applicants:**\n  - Subject to additional review criteria focusing on institutional eligibility and NIH foreign award policies.\n  - Require additional NIH review and higher-level approvals before funding can be awarded.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n\n- NIH Standard Terms of Award for Individual Fellowships, Sections 11.2.13.8 and 11.2.9.9 (Documents 1-8).\n- Management of Intra-IHE Consulting Activities, Sections chapter_in IIB (Documents 9-10).\n- Additional Review and Approval Requirements for Foreign Applicants (SYNTHESIS section).\n\nThis comprehensive approach ensures compliance with NIH policies, proper management of funds, and appropriate oversight of foreign fellowship awards."}

Eligibility and Full-Time Requirement:**\n\n- Short-term research training under NIH T32 (traditional institutional research training grants) and T35 (exclusively short-term trainees) applies specifically to students in health-professional schools.\n- The training duration is typically 2 to 3 months.\n- All short-term training must be full-time, meaning the trainee must dedicate full-time effort during the training period.\n- Unless otherwise stated, the requirements that apply to institutional research training grants also apply to short-term research training (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4; Section 11.3.2.5.3).\n\n**2. Budgeting Participant Support Costs:**\n\n- Participant support costs include stipends, tuition, fees, travel, supplies, and other training-related expenses.\n- For short-term trainees, institutions may budget up to one-twelfth of the annual training-related expenses amount per month to cover these costs. This reflects the prorated portion of the annual amount based on the short duration of training.\n- Training-related expenses are awarded as a lump sum based on predetermined amounts per trainee, published in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts.\n- When Kirschstein-NRSA support covers only some trainees in a program, institutions must allocate the appropriate portion of global costs to the training grant.\n- Institutions should ensure that the budgeted amounts reflect full-time status for short-term trainees (SYNTHESIS; Documents 9, 10; Section 11.3.8.4).\n\n**3. Cost Considerations and Compliance with Federal Regulations:**\n\n- All costs must comply with applicable Federal cost principles and NIH guidelines.\n- Health insurance (self-only or family coverage) is allowable only if the institution applies such charges consistently to all individuals in a similar training status, regardless of funding source.

Compliance with 2 CFR Part 200, including \u00a7 200.507(b)(2) and (b)(4):**\n\n- **Applicability:**  \n  While 2 CFR Part 200, Subpart F audit requirements primarily apply to State/local governments and non-profit organizations expending $750,000 or more annually in Federal awards, for-profit organizations have specific audit requirements addressed separately in NIH GPS chapters (Documents 1-4). However, when a for-profit organization elects to conduct a program-specific audit (instead of an organization-wide audit), it must comply with the provisions of 2 CFR \u00a7 200.507.\n\n- **Prior Approval:**  \n  The organization must obtain prior written approval from the NIH awarding Institute/Center (IC) before conducting a program-specific audit (SYNTHESIS).\n\n- **Audit Scope (\u00a7 200.507(b)(2)):**  \n  The audit must cover the program\u2019s financial statements and compliance requirements. This means the auditor must examine the financial statements related to the specific NIH grant program and assess compliance with applicable Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the award.\n\n- **Internal Controls (\u00a7 200.507(b)(4)):**  \n  The auditor must report on internal control over compliance and identify any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. This involves evaluating the effectiveness of the recipient\u2019s internal controls related to compliance with Federal program requirements.\n\n- **Audit Standards:**  \n  The audit must be conducted in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS).\n\n- **Audit Report Package:**  \n  The audit report package must include:  \n  - Financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards.  \n  - Independent auditor\u2019s report covering financial statements, compliance, and internal controls.  \n  - Schedule of findings and questioned costs.  \n  - Summary of prior audit findings and corrective action plan, if applicable.\n\n- **Additional Audits:**  \n  The program-specific audit is in lieu of a financial audit of individual Federal awards but does not preclude additional audits if required by Federal agencies.\n\n- **Procurement of Audit Services:**  \n  Procurement of audit services must comply with 2 CFR Part 200 procurement standards, including competition and affirmative efforts to use small, minority, and women-owned businesses. The recipient\u2019s written agreement with auditors must clearly specify rights and responsibilities (SYNTHESIS).\n\n**2. NIH-Specific Application Requirements and Due Dates (NIH GPS Sections 11.2.3 and 18):**\n\n- **Submission of Audit Reports:**  \n  NIH requires that the audit reporting package be submitted electronically to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC) as specified in NIH GPS Part III (SYNTHESIS).\n\n- **Timeliness:**  \n  Audit reports must be submitted timely according to NIH and Federal deadlines to avoid compliance issues. While exact due dates are not specified in the retrieved documents, NIH GPS sections 11.2.3 and 18 emphasize adherence to these deadlines.\n\n- **Consortium Participants:**  \n  NIH does not require consortium participants to have audits unless they meet the $750,000 threshold under 2 CFR Part 200.501. If a consortium participant meets this threshold, the recipient must obtain and review the audit and resolve findings related to the consortium agreement.

The key points are as follows:\n\n1. **Tuition and Fees Reimbursement Limits:**\n\n   - **Predoctoral Fellowships (F30, F31):**  \n     NIH reimburses 60% of the tuition and fees amount requested by the institution, capped at $16,000 per year. For formally combined dual-degree programs (e.g., M.D.-Ph.D., D.D.S.-Ph.D.), the cap is higher, at $21,000 per year.  \n     *(See Documents 1-4, Section 11.2.9.5)*\n\n   - **Postdoctoral Fellowships (F32) and Senior Fellowships (F33):**  \n     NIH reimburses 60% of the requested tuition and fees, capped at $4,500 per year. However, if the postdoctoral fellow is enrolled in formal degree-granting training, the cap increases to $16,000 per year. Tuition and fees for postdoctoral fellows are allowable only if required for specific courses that support research training.  \n     *(See Documents 1-4, Section 11.2.9.5)*\n\n2. **Health Insurance Costs:**\n\n   - Health insurance costs (including self-only or family coverage, and potentially vision and dental if consistent with institutional policy) are **not included** in the tuition and fees budget. Instead, these costs must be charged under the **Institutional Allowance** or **Training-Related Expenses** category.  \n   - Health insurance must be applied **consistently** to all individuals in similar training status at the institution, regardless of their source of support.  \n   *(See Documents 1-4, Section 11.2.9.5; Documents 9-10, Section 11.3.8.4)*\n\n3. **Institutional Allowance / Training-Related Expenses:**\n\n   - This category covers health insurance, staff salaries, consultant costs, equipment, supplies, travel, and other training-related expenses.  \n   - Funds are awarded as a lump sum per trainee, based on predetermined amounts published in NIH program announcements.  \n   - Institutions that have global costs for training programs (where NIH support covers only some trainees) must allocate an appropriate portion of these costs to the NIH training grant, applying consistent cost principles.  \n   - The budget for training-related expenses is finite, so institutions must apply core cost principles of allocation and consistent treatment carefully.  \n   - Extraordinary costs (e.g., disability accommodations) may be requested with detailed justification and NIH consultation.  \n   *(See Documents 9-10, Section 11.3.8.4)*\n\n4. **Pre-award Costs:**\n\n   - Tuition and fees, as well as stipends, **cannot** be charged as pre-award costs before the fellow activates the award.  \n   - Institutional allowance costs may rarely be allowable as pre-award costs but only with NIH approval.  \n   *(See SYNTHESIS section)*\n\n5. **Cost Principles and Consistency:**\n\n   - Institutions must apply core cost principles, ensuring consistent treatment of costs across trainees regardless of funding source.  \n   - Health insurance and other training-related expenses must be charged consistently to all trainees in similar status.  \n   *(See Documents 9-10, Section 11.3.8.4; SYNTHESIS)*\n\n6. **Flexibility Allowed by Rebudgeting Provisions:**\n\n   - While the tuition and fees reimbursement is capped and fixed at 60% of requested amounts up to the specified limits, institutions have flexibility in allocating training-related expenses within the lump sum provided for institutional allowance.  \n   - This allows institutions to manage indirect costs such as health insurance, staff salaries, and other training-related expenses, provided they adhere to NIH cost principles and consistent application.  \n   - Requests for extraordinary costs beyond standard levels require justification and NIH consultation.  \n   *(See Documents 9-10, Section 11.3.8.4; SYNTHESIS)*\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- NIH reimburses tuition and fees for individual fellowships at 60% of requested amounts, with caps of $16,000/year for predoctoral fellows ($21,000 for dual-degree programs) and $4,500/year for postdoctoral fellows (up to $16,000 if in formal degree programs).  \n- Health insurance costs are excluded from tuition and fees and must be charged under institutional allowance/training-related expenses, applied consistently to all trainees in similar status.  \n- Institutional allowance funds cover health insurance and other training-related expenses and are awarded as lump sums per trainee, requiring institutions to allocate costs appropriately and consistently.  \n- Tuition and stipends cannot be charged pre-award; institutional allowance costs may be charged pre-award only with NIH approval.  \n- Institutions have flexibility in managing training-related expenses within the lump sum but must follow NIH cost principles and justify any extraordinary costs.  \n\nThis comprehensive approach ensures that tuition and fees are reimbursed within defined limits, health insurance is properly classified and consistently applied, and institutions maintain flexibility while adhering to NIH policies and cost principles.\n\n**References:**  \n- Tuition and Fees Policy: Documents 1-4 (Section 11.2.9.5)  \n- Health Insurance and Training-Related Expenses: Documents 9-10 (Section 11.3.8.4)  \n- General Policy and Cost Principles: SYNTHESIS section"}

The key requirements are as follows:\n\n1. **Separation of Donation Value in Indirect Cost Rates (\u00a7 200.300):**  \n   When donations are treated as indirect costs, the indirect cost rates **must separate the value of the donations** so that reimbursement is not made for the donated items or services. This means the value of donations should be excluded from the reimbursable indirect costs to avoid double payment or improper reimbursement.  \n   - This is explicitly stated in \u00a7 200.300 and reiterated in multiple documents (Documents 1-4).\n\n2. **Valuation and Inclusion of Donated Services (\u00a7 200.306):**  \n   - For nonprofit organizations, the value of donated services used in direct cost activities must be included in the indirect cost rate calculation if:  \n     a) The aggregate value of the donated services is material, and  \n     b) The services are supported by a significant amount of indirect costs incurred by the recipient or subrecipient.  \n   - If the fair market value of the donated services cannot be determined, the recipient or subrecipient and the cognizant agency for indirect costs must negotiate an appropriate allocation of indirect costs to those services.  \n   - Indirect costs allocated to donated services that directly benefit a federally supported project may be reimbursed or used as cost sharing.  \n   - Donated services should be supported by documentation and methods similar to those used for regular personnel services to demonstrate allocability and allow proper valuation (Document 5, 6, 7, 8).\n\n3. **Valuation of Donated Property (\u00a7 200.414 and related):**  \n   - Donated property included as cost sharing must be valued at fair market value at the time of donation.  \n   - For donated equipment, buildings, or land, if the federal award assists in acquisition, the full value may be claimed as cost sharing; otherwise, only depreciation or fair rental charges may be claimed.  \n   - This ensures that the valuation is reasonable and consistent with federal cost principles (Synthesis and Document 5).\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo comply with 2 CFR Part 200 when treating donations as indirect costs, recipients and subrecipients must:  \n- **Separate the value of donations in their indirect cost rates** to avoid reimbursement for donated items or services (\u00a7 200.300).  \n- **Include the value of material donated services in the indirect cost rate calculation**, allocating a proportionate share of indirect costs, supported by appropriate documentation (\u00a7 200.306).  \n- **Negotiate with the cognizant agency** when fair market value cannot be determined (\u00a7 200.306).  \n- **Value donated property at fair market value** and apply appropriate cost sharing or depreciation rules (\u00a7 200.414).  \n\nThis approach ensures that donated resources are properly accounted for in indirect cost rates, preventing improper reimbursement while allowing indirect costs related to donated services to be recognized and reimbursed or used as cost sharing where appropriate.\n\n**References:**  \n- 2 CFR \u00a7 200.300 (Documents 1-4)  \n- 2 CFR \u00a7 200.306 (Documents 5-8)  \n- 2 CFR \u00a7 200.414 (Synthesis)"}

Specifically:\n\n1. **Risk Assessment Procedures:**\n   - NIH conducts risk assessments consistent with 2 CFR Part 200, which includes evaluating the responsibility and qualifications of award recipients.\n   - This process involves checks through the System for Award Management (SAM.gov) as mandated by Public Law 112-239 (National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2013). NIH recipients with active federal awards exceeding $10 million must comply with enhanced reporting and risk evaluation requirements (see Sections 4.1.34 in Documents 5-8).\n   - These risk assessments inform NIH funding decisions and ongoing monitoring activities to ensure compliance and mitigate potential risks associated with federal awards (SYNTHESIS).\n\n2. **Mandatory Disclosure Requirements Related to Federal Criminal Law Violations:**\n   - **Who Must Disclose:** All NIH applicants, recipients, and subrecipients are required to disclose relevant information (Documents 1-4, Section 4.1.35).\n   - **What to Disclose:** Any information related to violations of federal criminal law involving fraud, bribery, or gratuity violations that could potentially impact the federal award must be disclosed (Documents 1-4).\n   - **When to Disclose:** Disclosures must be made in a timely manner and in writing (Documents 1-4).\n   - **To Whom to Disclose:**\n     - NIH awarding Institute or Center (IC) Grants Management Officer (CGMO) listed on the Notice of Award (NoA).\n     - U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG), Attention: Mandatory Grant Disclosures, Intake Coordinator (Documents 1-4).\n   - **Subrecipient Disclosures:** Subrecipients must disclose such violations to the pass-through entity (the recipient) and the HHS OIG (Documents 1-4).\n\n3. **Additional NIH Disclosure Requirements for Senior/Key Personnel:**\n   - Senior/key personnel designated in NIH applications must submit disclosures during application preparation and annual progress reports, including:\n     - Biographical Sketch\n     - Other Support\n     - Financial Conflicts of Interest (Documents 9-10, Section 8.4.1.8).\n   - These disclosures assist NIH reviewers and staff in making informed funding decisions.\n   - Failure to comply with these disclosure requirements may result in serious consequences such as:\n     - Disallowance of costs\n     - Withholding of further awards\n     - Suspension or termination of the grant pending corrective action (Documents 9-10).\n   - Potential criminal violations identified through these disclosures are referred to the NIH Office of Management Assessment and may be further referred to the HHS OIG, Department of Justice, or other law enforcement agencies for investigation and enforcement (Documents 9-10).\n\n**Summary:**\nNIH integrates federal risk assessment mandates under 2 CFR \u00a7 200.208 by performing responsibility and qualification checks via SAM.gov and applying enhanced risk evaluation for large award recipients. This process supports funding decisions and ongoing compliance monitoring for Smartlink II/ACH IIA-64 awards.

Conference grants typically support planning, conducting, and post-conference follow-up activities, and do not allow general support for international conferences except for specific aspects (SYNTHESIS).  \n   - The recipient must specify allowable and unallowable costs in the consortium agreement consistent with NIH policies (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4).\n\n3. **Indirect Cost (F&A) Rates for Subrecipients**  \n   - The recipient must use an approved federally negotiated indirect cost rate for each subrecipient (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4).  \n   - If a subrecipient does not have a federally negotiated rate, the recipient may:  \n     - Use a rate negotiated between the recipient and the subrecipient (including for-profit organizations, except for SBIR/STTR programs), or  \n     - Apply the de minimis indirect cost rate of 10% of modified total direct costs (MTDC) if the subrecipient has never received a negotiated rate from the Federal Government (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4).  \n   - For Federal organizations participating as consortium participants, direct costs are limited and no F&A costs are reimbursed (Documents 1, 2, 3, 4).  \n   - No profit or fee is allowed to for-profit organizations as recipients or consortium participants under NIH grants (Documents 5, 6, 7, 8).\n\n4. **Comprehensive Safety Plan Requirement**  \n   - NIH conference grants require a comprehensive safety plan to promote a harassment-free environment. While the detailed content of this plan is not specified in the documents, the recipient must ensure this requirement is met and incorporated into the conference planning and consortium agreements (SYNTHESIS).\n\n5. **Program Income Handling**  \n   - Program income generated from the conference must be managed according to NIH program income policies, which also flow down to consortium participants (Documents 1, 9, 10).  \n   - Depending on the NIH award terms, program income must either be deducted from total allowable costs or added to the project funds to further the project objectives (SYNTHESIS).  \n   - The consortium agreement should specify how program income will be accounted for and applied to ensure compliance with NIH requirements.\n\n6. **Recipient Oversight Responsibilities**  \n   - The recipient must perform substantive oversight of all scientific, programmatic, financial, and administrative aspects of the consortium activities, not merely pass funds through (Documents 9, 10).  \n   - This includes ensuring compliance with cost principles, indirect cost rates, program income policies, and the harassment-free safety plan.\n\n**Summary:**  \nTo comply with NIH and federal regulations when preparing a consortium agreement for an NIH-supported conference grant with a harassment-free safety plan, the recipient must:\n\n- Include all applicable NIH and government-wide cost principles and policies, specifying allowable and unallowable costs consistent with NIH conference grant rules.  \n- Use federally negotiated indirect cost rates for subrecipients or apply a negotiated or de minimis 10% MTDC rate if none exists.  \n- Prohibit profit or fee payments to for-profit consortium participants.  \n- Incorporate program income policies, ensuring income generated by the conference is properly accounted for and applied according to NIH terms.  \n- Ensure the consortium agreement includes the comprehensive safety plan requirement and that all terms and conditions flow down to subrecipients.  \n- Maintain substantive oversight of all consortium activities.\n\nThis approach ensures compliance with NIH grant terms, federal cost principles (2 CFR Part 200), and NIH-specific policies for conference grants, including the critical requirement for a harassment-free environment (SYNTHESIS; Documents 1\u20134, 5\u20138, 9\u201310)."}

This includes providing accurate and timely information about:  \n  - Award amount  \n  - Purpose of the award  \n  - Recipient details  \n  - Performance and financial reports  \n- Compliance with these requirements is mandatory and flows down to any subawards and subrecipients unless otherwise specified.  \n- Failure to comply with these public access and reporting requirements may affect the recipient\u2019s continued funding and eligibility for future awards.  \n- (Synthesis; see also NIH Grants Policy Statement introduction and relevant sections)\n\n**Summary for Compliance:**  \n- Upon award, the institution must ensure that all required Federal award information is accurately reported and made publicly accessible in accordance with 2 CFR \u00a7 200.212.  \n- The institution must adhere to all terms and conditions of the NIH grant, including transparency and reporting obligations.  \n- These requirements also apply to subrecipients and subawards unless explicitly exempted.  \n\n---\n\n### References to Specific Sections and Documents\n\n- **Eligibility and Support Mechanisms:** NIH Grants Policy Statement Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 (Documents 1-4, 5-8)  \n- **Public Access Requirements:** 2 CFR \u00a7 200.212 as summarized in the synthesis and NIH Grants Policy Statement introduction (Documents 9 and 10)  \n- **General NIH Grants Policy Statement Overview:** Introduction sections in Documents 9 and 10  \n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo determine if an institution qualifies for a specific NIH support mechanism, it must:  \n- Identify the relevant activity code and program.  \n- Confirm eligibility based on broad NIH criteria and any special requirements in the NOFO or program guidelines.  \n\nOnce awarded, the institution must:  \n- Comply with the public access and transparency requirements under 2 CFR \u00a7 200.212 by ensuring accurate and timely reporting of award information.  \n- Adhere to all NIH grant terms and conditions, including flow-down requirements to subrecipients.  \n\nFailure to meet these requirements may jeopardize current and future NIH funding.\n\n---\n\nThis comprehensive approach ensures that institutions understand both their eligibility and their responsibilities regarding public access and transparency when receiving NIH grants.\n\n**Sources:**  \n- NIH Grants Policy Statement Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 (Documents 1-4, 5-8)  \n- 2 CFR \u00a7 200.212 (Synthesis)  \n- NIH Grants Policy Statement Introduction (Documents 9 and 10)"}
{"id": "applied_hard_20", "question": "According to 2 CFR Part 200 Appendix VII B.7 and the NIH Grants Policy Statement section 12.3.6 on Level of Effort, how should a recipient manage and document the level of effort during the period of performance, especially when program income is generated? Specifically, how do the cost principles in 2 CFR 200.344(d) and (e) affect the treatment of costs incidental to generating program income and the classification of certain revenues, and what are the implications for closeout reporting under the Uniform Administrative Requirements?", "prediction": "According to 2 CFR Part 200 Appendix VII B.7 and the NIH Grants Policy Statement (NIH GPS) section 12.3.6 on Level of Effort (LOE), as well as the cost principles in 2 CFR 200.344(d) and (e), recipients must carefully manage and document the level of effort and program income during the period of performance, with specific implications for cost treatment and closeout reporting under the Uniform Administrative Requirements.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Management and Documentation of Level of Effort (LOE)\n\n- **Maintain Committed LOE:** Recipients are required to maintain the level of effort committed in the approved budget throughout the award period. This means the amount of time and effort devoted to the project should be consistent with what was proposed and approved (NIH GPS \u00a712.3.6; 2 CFR Part 200 Appendix VII B.7).\n\n- **Documentation Requirements:**  \n  - Time and effort must be adequately documented in accordance with the recipient\u2019s accounting and personnel systems.  \n  - Acceptable documentation includes timesheets, effort reports, or other records that clearly support the proportion of time devoted to the project (NIH GPS \u00a712.3.6; 2 CFR Part 200 Appendix VII B.7).  \n  - Documentation must be sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the committed LOE.\n\n- **Adjustments and Approvals:**  \n  - Any significant deviations from the committed LOE require prior approval from the awarding agency.  \n  - Minor deviations may be allowed if they do not adversely affect programmatic objectives (NIH GPS \u00a712.3.6).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Treatment of Program Income and Related Costs (2 CFR 200.344(d) and (e))\n\n- **Definition of Program Income:**  \n  Program income is defined as gross income earned by the recipient that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the award during the period of performance (2 CFR 200.344).\n\n- **Costs Incidental to Generating Program Income (200.344(d)):**  \n  - Costs incurred to generate program income are allowable only if they are reasonable, allocable to the award, and conform to federal cost principles.  \n  - Such costs must be charged either to the award or deducted from program income, depending on the terms of the award. This ensures that costs related to generating income are properly accounted for and do not inflate the award costs improperly.\n\n- **Classification and Use of Revenues (200.344(e)):**  \n  - Program income must be accounted for separately from award funds.  \n  - It must be used in accordance with the award terms, which may require adding the income to the project funds to further the project or using it to reduce the federal award costs.  \n  - Revenues that are not generated by the award or earned outside the period of performance are not considered program income and must be treated accordingly (e.g., as other income or unrelated revenue).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Implications for Closeout Reporting and Cost Allowability\n\n- **Allowable Closeout Costs (2 CFR 200.414(b)):**  \n  - Administrative costs directly related to closeout activities (such as salaries for personnel preparing final reports, publication and printing costs, equipment disposition, and related indirect costs) are allowable and chargeable to the final budget period of the award.  \n  - These costs may be incurred until the due date of the final report(s) and must be liquidated by that date unless otherwise specified by the federal agency (2 CFR 200.414(b); 2 CFR 200.300(h)).\n\n- **Financial Reporting Requirements:**  \n  - Recipients must submit Financial Expenditure Reports (FFRs) via the Payment Management System that accurately reflect actual expenditures, including those related to program income and closeout costs (NIH GPS \u00a78.4.1.5.2).  \n  - Reports must be timely and accurate; failure to submit may affect future funding.  \n  - The final FFR must include all allowable costs incurred during the award period, including costs incidental to generating program income and closeout costs.\n\n- **Monitoring and Compliance:**  \n  - The Grants Management Officer (GMO) monitors expenditures and may require adjustments based on audit findings or deviations from approved budgets.  \n  - Recipients certify that reported costs are allowable, allocable, and consistent with award terms (NIH GPS and 2 CFR Part 200 requirements).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Summary of Recipient Responsibilities\n\n- **Maintain and Document LOE:** Ensure that the level of effort committed in the approved budget is maintained and documented with adequate records. Seek prior approval for significant changes.\n\n- **Properly Account for Program Income:**  \n  - Identify and separately account for program income generated during the period of performance.  \n  - Charge costs incidental to generating program income appropriately, either to the award or deducted from program income, consistent with 2 CFR 200.344(d).  \n  - Use program income in accordance with award terms (2 CFR 200.344(e)).\n\n- **Charge Allowable Closeout Costs:** Include administrative closeout costs in the final budget period and liquidate them before the final report due date.\n\n- **Submit Accurate Closeout Reports:** Provide complete and timely financial reports that include all costs and program income activities.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n- **Level of Effort:** NIH Grants Policy Statement \u00a712.3.6; 2 CFR Part 200 Appendix VII B.7  \n- **Program Income and Related Costs:** 2 CFR 200.344(d) and (e)  \n- **Closeout Costs and Reporting:** 2 CFR 200.414(b); 2 CFR 200.300(h); NIH GPS \u00a78.4.1.5.2\n\n---\n\nIn conclusion, recipients must maintain and document the committed level of effort, properly account for program income and related costs per federal cost principles, and ensure all allowable costs, including closeout costs, are charged appropriately and reported accurately in closeout financial reports. This comprehensive approach ensures compliance with federal regulations and award terms throughout the award lifecycle."}
{"id": "applied_hard_21", "question": "According to 2 CFR 200.448(b)(2)(iii), how should an organization allocate costs for a grant when additional review criteria outlined in NIH GPS section 2.4.1.4 apply, and how can the organization contact the appropriate Cost Allocation Services office for assistance if located in California?", "prediction": "According to 2 CFR 200.448(b)(2)(iii) and the additional NIH Grants Policy Statement (NIH GPS) section 2.4.1.4 criteria, an organization must allocate costs for a grant based on the proportional benefits received by each project. This means costs should be assigned consistently and equitably, reflecting the extent to which each grant benefits from the costs incurred. When additional NIH GPS review criteria apply\u2014such as when a detailed budget is required\u2014a thorough cost analysis must be conducted. This cost analysis involves:\n\n- Obtaining detailed cost breakdowns,\n- Validating the cost data,\n- Evaluating the necessity, reasonableness, and allowability of the costs included in the budget.\n\nThe Grants Management Officer (GMO) ensures this cost analysis is performed and assesses the adequacy of the organization\u2019s financial and business management systems to support cost allocation and accountability in compliance with 2 CFR Part 200 standards (see Documents 1-4, Section 2.5.5).\n\nIf the organization treats all costs as direct costs (i.e., does not use a Facilities & Administrative (F&A) cost rate), its accounting system must be capable of segregating and identifying costs commensurate with the benefits to individual projects. This requires a process that assigns costs based on the proportional benefit to each project, ensuring proper cost allocation and compliance with financial management system standards (see Synthesis and Documents 9-10, Section 7.4).\n\nRegarding F&A costs, NIH generally reimburses these only if the recipient has an established negotiated F&A cost rate covering the relevant activities and period. Exceptions exist if the organization operates a single grant-supported project or consistently treats all costs as direct costs with an adequate accounting system. F&A rates are negotiated by the NIH Cost Allocation Services (CAS) office or other cognizant agencies. If the GMO advises the organization to establish an F&A rate, the GMO will provide contact information for the appropriate office (see Synthesis and Documents 9-10, Section 7.4).\n\nFor organizations located in California seeking assistance with cost allocation or establishing an F&A rate, they should contact the NIH Cost Allocation Services (CAS) regional office responsible for the Western U.S. The CAS is part of the Division of Cost Allocation (DCA) within the Office of Acquisition Management and Policy at NIH. The GMO will provide the specific contact information for CAS when needed. Additional contact details are typically available on NIH official websites or through the GMO (see Synthesis).\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Cost Allocation:** Allocate costs based on proportional benefits to each grant, supported by adequate financial and business management systems per 2 CFR 200.448(b)(2)(iii) and NIH GPS 2.4.1.4. Conduct thorough cost analysis when detailed budgets are required.\n- **F&A Costs:** Generally require an established negotiated F&A rate unless all costs are treated as direct costs with an adequate accounting system.\n- **Contact for California Organizations:** Contact the NIH CAS regional office serving the Western U.S. as directed by the GMO for assistance with cost allocation and F&A rate establishment.\n\n**References:**\n\n- Cost allocation and cost analysis requirements: Documents 1-4 (Section 2.5.5)\n- F&A cost reimbursement and negotiation: Documents 9-10 (Section 7.4)\n- Contacting CAS for California: Synthesis section on Cost Allocation Services\n\nThis comprehensive approach ensures compliance with federal regulations and NIH policies for proper cost allocation and reimbursement under NIH grants."}
{"id": "applied_hard_22", "question": "For an independent (non-mentored) NIH Career Development Award (CDA) recipient who is conducting clinical research involving research patients in a hospital setting, how should the research patient care costs be identified and allocated according to NIH guidelines, and what are the key exclusions from these costs? Additionally, how do the Uniform Administrative Requirements under 2 CFR Part 200.410 influence the allowability of these costs under the grant award?", "prediction": "For an independent (non-mentored) NIH Career Development Award (CDA) recipient conducting clinical research involving research patients in a hospital setting, the identification, allocation, and allowability of research patient care costs must follow NIH policies in conjunction with federal cost principles under 2 CFR Part 200. Below is a comprehensive explanation based on the retrieved documents:\n\n---\n\n### Identification and Allocation of Research Patient Care Costs\n\n1. **Definition of Research Patient Care Costs:**\n   - These costs include expenses for hospital services or tests that go beyond usual patient care or extend the hospitalization period due to research participation.\n   - Costs that would have been incurred regardless of the research (i.e., usual care costs) are generally **not allowable** charges to NIH grants.\n   - If patients are hospitalized or receive tests/services **solely because of research participation** (e.g., healthy volunteers, normal controls, or patients hospitalized only for study purposes), then **all costs** for their hospitalization or services may be charged to the grant (Documents 9 and 10, Section 19.4).\n\n2. **Determining Extent of Research-Related Costs:**\n   - The recipient (hospital or institution) must determine and document the extent to which hospitalization, tests, or services exceed usual care.\n   - This involves assessing whether the research extends the hospitalization period or imposes additional procedures/tests beyond what would ordinarily be expected (Documents 9 and 10, Section 19.4).\n   - Documentation is critical to justify the allocation of costs to the NIH grant.\n\n3. **Cost Allocation Principles:**\n   - Research patient care costs must be computed consistent with Medicare principles for reasonable costs.\n   - Separate cost centers should be established for each discrete bed unit to properly allocate routine costs (SYNTHESIS).\n   - Hospitals expecting to incur **more than $100,000** in research patient care costs per budget period on a single NIH grant must negotiate a research patient care rate agreement with the cognizant Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) office.\n   - Hospitals expecting **$100,000 or less** or consortium participants have special procedural requirements (Documents 5-8, Section 19.3).\n\n---\n\n### Key Exclusions from Research Patient Care Costs\n\n- Costs for routine or standard treatment regimens that do not exceed usual care are **not allowable**.\n- Patient care costs for accepted treatments compared against new therapies are generally **not allowable**, except for additional measurements or services specified by the study protocol that exceed usual care.\n- Any costs not documented as exceeding usual care or not related to research participation are excluded (Documents 9 and 10, Section 19.4).\n- Essentially, only the **incremental costs** attributable to research participation beyond usual care are allowable.\n\n---\n\n### Influence of Uniform Administrative Requirements (2 CFR Part 200.410)\n\n- Research patient care costs must meet the allowability criteria under **2 CFR Part 200.410**, which requires that costs be:\n  - **Necessary and reasonable** for the performance of the award.\n  - **Allocable** to the project (i.e., directly related to the research).\n  - Treated **consistently** as allowable costs in like circumstances.\n  - **Adequately documented** to support the charges.\n- Costs must also comply with **2 CFR Part 200, Appendix IX (Hospital Cost Principles)**, which governs proper cost identification and reimbursement.\n- Negotiated research patient care rates with the CAS office must be used for reimbursement claims.\n- Provisional rates represent maximum reimbursable amounts and must be adjusted if final negotiated rates are lower (SYNTHESIS).\n\n---\n\n### Summary for NIH CDA Recipients Conducting Clinical Research in Hospitals\n\n- Identify research patient care costs as those that exceed usual care or are incurred solely due to research participation.\n- Document carefully the extent to which hospitalization, tests, or services are research-related.\n- Allocate costs using Medicare-based cost principles and establish separate cost centers as needed.\n- If research patient care costs exceed $100,000 per budget period on a single NIH grant, negotiate a research patient care rate agreement with the CAS office.\n- Exclude routine care costs and costs for accepted treatments unless additional research-specified services are provided.\n- Ensure all costs meet the allowability criteria under 2 CFR Part 200.410 and comply with NIH hospital cost principles for reimbursement.\n- Use negotiated rates for reimbursement claims and adjust provisional rates as necessary.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n\n- NIH Grants Policy Statement, Sections 19.1 (General), 19.3 (Policy), and 19.4 (Allowable Costs) [Documents 1-10].\n- Uniform Administrative Requirements under 2 CFR Part 200.410 and Appendix IX (Hospital Cost Principles) [SYNTHESIS].\n- Specific policy on research patient care rate negotiation for hospitals incurring >$100,000 in costs [Documents 5-8].\n\nThis framework ensures that NIH funds are used appropriately to cover only those patient care costs directly attributable to research activities, consistent with federal regulations and NIH policies."}

Specifically, can a sponsoring institution charge pre-award costs such as stipends or tuition under a fixed amount award for an individual fellowship, and what steps should be taken to ensure compliance with both NIH and federal regulations?", "prediction": "Based on the information synthesized from the retrieved documents, the interaction between the limitations on pre-award costs for individual fellowships described in NIH GPS 11.2.9.1 and the federal cost principles in 2 CFR 200.431(b)(3)(i), particularly in the context of fixed amount awards, can be comprehensively explained as follows:\n\n1. **Definitions and Context:**\n\n- According to 2 CFR 200.1, federal awards include grants, cooperative agreements, and fixed amount awards. Fixed amount awards are designed to reduce administrative burden by not requiring detailed cost documentation but must still comply with applicable federal regulations and terms of award (SYNTHESIS).\n\n- NIH individual fellowships (Kirschstein-NRSA) are awarded under NIH Standard Terms of Award with specific exceptions (11.2.13.8), and although 2 CFR 200 cost principles generally apply, NIH GPS imposes specific allowable cost rules for these fellowships (SYNTHESIS).\n\n2. **Pre-Award Costs Limitations for Individual Fellowships (NIH GPS 11.2.9.1):**\n\n- Stipends and tuition/fees **cannot** be charged as pre-award costs for individual fellowships. These costs are only allowable after the fellow has activated the award and submitted the required paperwork to NIH (Documents 1-4, 11.2.9.1).\n\n- Institutional allowances may be charged as pre-award costs **only in rare cases** and require prior consultation and approval from the NIH awarding Institute/Center (IC) (Documents 1-4, 11.2.9.1).\n\n- This restriction is stricter than for training grants, where some pre-award costs may be allowable but still require NIH IC consultation (Documents 5-6, 11.3.8.1).\n\n3. **Federal Cost Principles (2 CFR 200.431(b)(3)(i)):**\n\n- Stipends, tuition, and institutional allowances must be allowable, reasonable, and allocable to the award.\n\n- Pre-award costs must be necessary and incurred in anticipation of the award.\n\n- However, NIH GPS imposes stricter limits for individual fellowships, overriding the general allowance for pre-award costs in 2 CFR 200 when it comes to stipends and tuition (SYNTHESIS).\n\n4. **Interaction Between NIH GPS and 2 CFR 200:**\n\n- While 2 CFR 200 generally permits pre-award costs if reasonable and necessary, NIH GPS 11.2.9.1 specifically prohibits charging stipends and tuition before award activation for individual fellowships.\n\n- Institutional allowances may be an exception but only with NIH IC approval (SYNTHESIS).\n\n5. **Fixed Amount Awards and Pre-Award Costs:**\n\n- Fixed amount awards simplify administration by not requiring detailed cost documentation but do **not** override NIH GPS restrictions on pre-award costs for fellowships.\n\n- Therefore, sponsoring institutions **cannot** charge stipends or tuition as pre-award costs even under fixed amount awards (SYNTHESIS).\n\n6. **Compliance Steps for Sponsoring Institutions:**\n\n- Do **not** charge stipends or tuition/fees as pre-award costs for individual fellowships (Documents 1-4).\n\n- Consult with the NIH awarding IC before charging any institutional allowance as a pre-award cost (Documents 1-4).\n\n- Ensure the award is activated and all required NIH paperwork is submitted before charging fellowship-related costs (Documents 1-4).\n\n- Follow NIH GPS terms alongside federal cost principles to ensure compliance (SYNTHESIS).\n\n- Maintain documentation of NIH IC consultations and approvals for any pre-award institutional allowance charges (SYNTHESIS).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Answer:**\n\nSponsoring institutions **cannot** charge stipends or tuition/fees as pre-award costs for individual fellowships, regardless of whether the award is a fixed amount award or not. This prohibition is explicitly stated in NIH GPS 11.2.9.1 and takes precedence over the more general federal cost principles in 2 CFR 200.431(b)(3)(i), which otherwise allow pre-award costs if reasonable and necessary.\n\nInstitutional allowances may be charged as pre-award costs only in rare cases and only after prior consultation and approval from the NIH awarding Institute/Center. Fixed amount awards, while reducing administrative burden, do not exempt institutions from these NIH-specific restrictions.\n\nTo ensure compliance, sponsoring institutions must:\n\n- Wait until the fellow activates the award and submits the required NIH paperwork before charging stipends or tuition.\n\n- Obtain NIH IC approval before charging any institutional allowance as a pre-award cost.\n\n- Document all consultations and approvals.\n\n- Adhere to both NIH GPS terms and federal cost principles.\n\nThis approach ensures alignment with both NIH-specific fellowship award terms and overarching federal regulations.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n\n- NIH GPS 11.2.9.1 Pre-award Costs for Individual Fellowships (Documents 1-4)\n\n- 2 CFR 200.1 Definitions and Types of Federal Awards (SYNTHESIS)\n\n- 2 CFR 200.431(b)(3)(i) Cost Principles for Stipends, Tuition, and Institutional Allowances (SYNTHESIS)\n\n- NIH GPS 11.2.13.8 Applicability of NIH Standard Terms of Award for Individual Fellowships (Documents 7-10)\n\n- NIH GPS 11.3.8.1 Pre-Award Costs for Training Grants (Documents 5-6)\n\n- Overall Synthesis of NIH and Federal Regulations (SYNTHESIS)"}

{"id": "applied_hard_27", "question": "How should a recipient manage and justify short-term health-professional research training costs within an NIH award budget, considering the NIH peer review process for budget adjustments, the monthly limitation on training-related expenses, and the federal regulations on costs for conferences and training under 2 CFR 200.463(d)(4)?", "prediction": "To effectively manage and justify short-term health-professional research training costs within an NIH award budget, recipients should adhere to the following comprehensive guidelines derived from NIH policies, peer review considerations, and federal regulations:\n\n1. **Monthly Limitation on Short-Term Training Costs:**\n   - Recipients may allocate up to one-twelfth of the annual training-related expenses budget each month specifically for short-term health-professional research training positions. This allocation covers tuition, fees, travel, supplies, and other related expenses for each short-term trainee. This monthly cap ensures that expenditures are paced appropriately throughout the budget period.  \n   *(See Documents 1, 2, 3, 4 \u2014 Section 11.3.8.6)*\n\n2. **Definition and Allowable Training-Related Expenses:**\n   - Training-related expenses include a broad range of costs such as staff salaries, consultant fees, equipment, research supplies, staff travel, trainee health insurance (self-only or family coverage), speaker fees, meals (when ancillary to training), and other direct training program costs.  \n   - Health insurance costs must be applied consistently to all trainees in similar training statuses, regardless of funding source, and may include vision and dental coverage if consistent with institutional policy.  \n   - Medical liability or special insurance is allowable only if required by the nature of the research training (e.g., direct patient contact) and must be consistently applied to all similarly situated trainees. Optional insurances like disability or life insurance are generally not allowable unless specifically required.  \n   - Extraordinary costs, such as accommodations for disabilities, may be requested above standard levels but require detailed justification and prior consultation with NIH program staff.  \n   *(See Documents 5, 6, 7, 8 \u2014 Section 11.3.8.4)*\n\n3. **Budgeting and Cost Allocation Principles:**\n   - Training-related expenses are awarded as a lump sum based on predetermined per-trainee amounts published by NIH. Institutions must allocate these funds appropriately, applying core cost principles of reasonableness, allocability, and consistent treatment across trainees and cost categories.  \n   - For institutional training programs covering multiple trainees (some supported by Kirschstein-NRSA funds and others not), institutions should allocate the appropriate portion of global costs to the training grant.  \n   *(See Documents 5, 6, 7, 8 \u2014 Section 11.3.8.4)*\n\n4. **NIH Peer Review and Budget Adjustments:**\n   - Any rebudgeting of funds from trainee costs such as stipends, tuition, and fees to other budget categories requires prior NIH approval. An exception is trainee travel, which is not considered a trainee cost and may be rebudgeted without prior approval.  \n   - NIH may adjust awards during peer review or administrative processes to avoid budget overlap and to maintain the originally intended support for research development costs.  \n   *(See Document 8 \u2014 Section 11.3.8.4; Documents 9 and 10 \u2014 Section 12.3.6.2)*\n\n5. **Compliance with Federal Regulations on Conference and Training Costs (2 CFR 200.463(d)(4)):**\n   - Costs for conferences and training must comply with federal cost principles, including being reasonable, allocable, and consistently treated.  \n   - Meals and incidental costs are allowable only if provided in conjunction with an ancillary meeting related to the training grant and must be consistent with institutional policies on such expenses.  \n   *(See Documents 3, 4 \u2014 Section 11.3.8.6 and 11.3.8.4; Synthesis summary)*\n\n**Summary of Recipient Actions:**\n\n- **Plan and Monitor Monthly Expenditures:** Ensure that short-term training costs do not exceed one-twelfth of the annual training-related expenses budget per month.  \n- **Document and Justify Expenses:** Maintain detailed records and justification for all training-related expenses, ensuring consistency with NIH predetermined levels and institutional policies.  \n- **Seek Prior NIH Approval for Rebudgeting:** Obtain NIH approval before shifting funds from trainee stipends, tuition, or fees to other budget categories, except for trainee travel.  \n- **Consult NIH for Extraordinary Costs:** Engage NIH program staff in advance when requesting costs above standard levels, such as accommodations for disabilities.  \n- **Adhere to Federal Cost Principles:** Ensure all costs, especially those related to conferences, meals, and incidentals, comply with 2 CFR 200.463(d)(4) regarding reasonableness, allocability, and consistency.  \n\nBy following these guidelines, recipients can effectively manage and justify short-term health-professional research training costs within NIH awards, ensuring compliance with NIH policies, peer review expectations, and federal regulations.\n\n---\n\n**References:**  \n- Monthly limit on short-term training costs: Documents 1, 2, 3, 4 (11.3.8.6)  \n- Training-related expenses and allowable costs: Documents 5, 6, 7, 8 (11.3.8.4)  \n- NIH peer review and budget adjustments: Document 8 (11.3.8.4), Documents 9, 10 (12.3.6.2)  \n- Federal regulations on conference/training costs: Synthesis, Documents 3, 4 (11.3.8.6 and 11.3.8.4)"}

This protects consortium participants from undue audit burdens unless specifically required (Documents 9, 10).\n\nRegarding the **tax treatment and classification of Kirschstein-NRSA stipends under Section 117 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC)** and their relation to employment status:\n\n1. **Nature of Kirschstein-NRSA Stipends**  \n   - Kirschstein-NRSA stipends are provided as subsistence allowances to help defray living expenses during the research training experience.  \n   - These stipends are not provided as a condition of employment with either the Federal government (NIH) or the sponsoring institution.  \n   - The stipends must be paid according to NIH-established stipend levels based on a 12-month full-time training appointment and prorated if training ends early. The sponsoring institution submits termination notices to NIH, which adjusts funding accordingly (Documents 1, 2).\n\n2. **Employment Status and Tax Classification**  \n   - Receipt of Kirschstein-NRSA stipends does not imply employment by NIH or the sponsoring institution.  \n   - NIH policy does not prevent recipient organizations from hiring NRSA trainees/fellows as employees or providing employment benefits consistent with other employees at similar career stages, but the stipends themselves are distinct from wages or salaries.  \n   - Under Section 117 of the IRC, these stipends are treated as non-employment subsistence allowances and are not classified as wages for tax purposes (Synthesis, Documents 1, 2).\n\n**Summary:**  \n- NIH recipients subject to audit under 2 CFR Part 200 must conduct annual audits meeting GAGAS standards if federal expenditures exceed $750,000, procure audit services in compliance with federal procurement rules, maintain clear contracts with auditors, and submit audit reports as required. They must not impose audit requirements on consortium participants unless authorized by regulation.  \n- Kirschstein-NRSA stipends are subsistence allowances, not wages, and do not establish an employment relationship with NIH or the sponsoring institution. They are paid according to NIH stipend levels and adjusted for early termination. While recipients may employ NRSA fellows separately, the stipends themselves are not employment compensation under Section 117 of the IRC.\n\n**References:**  \n- Audit requirements and standards: Documents 5, 6, 7, 8; Synthesis section 1  \n- Procurement and audit service requirements: Synthesis section 1  \n- Consortium participant audit rules: Documents 9, 10; Synthesis section 1  \n- Kirschstein-NRSA stipend nature and tax treatment: Documents 1, 2; Synthesis section 2"}
