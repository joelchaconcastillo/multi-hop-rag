{"id": "applied_hard_1", "question": "According to NIH grant policies, what administrative requirements must a K99 award recipient fulfill to transition to the R00 phase without delay, and under what circumstances can a waiver be granted for these requirements?", "prediction": "According to NIH grant policies, the administrative requirements and conditions for a K99 award recipient to transition to the R00 phase without delay, as well as the circumstances under which waivers may be granted, are as follows:\n\n1. **Requirements to Transition to the R00 Phase Without Delay:**\n\n   - **Securing an Acceptable Position:**  \n     The K99 award recipient must secure a tenure-track, full-time assistant professor position or an equivalent independent position to transition to the R00 phase. This is a mandatory condition for the transition (Documents 2 and 7, Section 12.2.3.2.3).\n\n   - **Minimum Career Development Support Period:**  \n     It is expected that recipients will receive at least 12 months of mentored research training and career development support during the K99 phase before transitioning to the R00 phase. Early transition before 12 months requires prior approval from NIH (Documents 1 and 6, Section 12.2.3.2.2; Documents 3 and 8, Section 12.2.3.2.1).\n\n   - **No Delay Between Phases:**  \n     There should be no delay between the end of the K99 phase and the start of the R00 phase. The transition application for the R00 phase is administratively reviewed by NIH staff (not peer-reviewed), and timely submission and acceptance of this application are required (Documents 2 and 7, Section 12.2.3.2.3).\n\n   - **Prior Approval for Early Transition or No-Cost Extensions:**  \n     If a recipient wishes to transition earlier than 2 years or requests a no-cost extension to complete K99 goals, prior approval from NIH is required. No-cost extensions are not automatic and must be justified with a plan for continued career development and timely transition to an independent position (Documents 1 and 6, Section 12.2.3.2.2).\n\n   - **Submission of R00 Application:**  \n     The recipient must submit an application for the R00 phase with evidence of a suitable independent position. Failure to submit this application within one year of a no-cost extension will result in no award of the R00 phase (Documents 1 and 6, Section 12.2.3.2.2).\n\n2. **Circumstances Under Which a Waiver or Exception May Be Granted:**\n\n   - **Early Transition Prior Approval:**  \n     Early transition before the minimum 12 months of K99 support is considered a prior approval request and is subject to NIH approval (Documents 1 and 6, Section 12.2.3.2.2).\n\n   - **Extension of K99 Eligibility Window:**  \n     NIH may consider requests for extension of the K99 eligibility window for reasons such as medical concerns, disability, family care (including childbirth), extended clinical training, natural disasters, and active military service. Each request is reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For childbirth, NIH will approve a one-year extension within the 4-year eligibility window (Documents 3 and 8, Section 12.2.3.2.1).\n\n   - **No-Cost Extensions:**  \n     No-cost extensions of the K99 phase may be granted with prior NIH approval to allow additional time to complete career development goals and secure an independent position. Recipients must submit a plan for continued career development and timely transition (Documents 1 and 6, Section 12.2.3.2.2).\n\n   - **Waivers for Kirschstein-NRSA Support Limits:**  \n     Although not specific to the K99/R00 transition, any exceptions to the maximum period of Kirschstein-NRSA support require a waiver from the NIH awarding IC based on justification from the individual and institution. The request must be made in writing by the Authorized Organizational Representative (AOR) and endorsed by the trainee\u2019s PD/PI (Documents 4 and 9, Section 11.3.6.3).\n\nIn summary, to transition to the R00 phase without delay, a K99 award recipient must secure an appropriate independent position, complete at least 12 months of career development support during the K99 phase (unless NIH approves early transition), submit a timely R00 application, and avoid any gap between phases. Waivers or exceptions to these requirements can be granted by NIH under specific circumstances such as medical or family-related reasons, with appropriate prior approval and justification.\n\n**References:**  \n- K99 Phase and Transition Requirements: Documents 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 (Sections 12.2.3.2.1, 12.2.3.2.2, 12.2.3.2.3)  \n- Waivers and Extensions: Documents 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 (Sections 11.3.6.3, 12.2.3.2.1, 12.2.3.2.2)"}

This is explicitly stated in Document 2 and Document 7 (Section 12.12).\n   - Consultation with the applicable NIH program staff and/or grants management staff is strongly encouraged when a change of institution is being considered (Documents 1 and 6, Section 12.12).\n\n2. **Documentation Required:**\n   - For mentored CDAs, the recipient must have a mentor at the new institution.\n   - If the transfer involves a change in mentor, supporting documentation from the new mentor is required. This documentation likely includes a letter or statement confirming the mentor\u2019s commitment to support the recipient\u2019s career development under the award (Documents 1, 2, 6, and 7, Section 12.12).\n   - The Change of Recipient Organization policies described in IIA apply to individual CDAs transferring between domestic institutions (Documents 2 and 7, Section 12.12).\n\n3. **Initiation of Support at the New Institution:**\n   - The recipient has the authority to extend the final budget period of the project period without additional funds for up to 12 months under the NIH Standard Terms of Award (Documents 1 and 6, Section 12.12).\n   - All terms and conditions and programmatic requirements continue to apply during any extension period.\n   - The full-time appointment and minimum effort requirements must continue for the entire extension period.\n   - Recipients should consider these requirements carefully when deciding how much additional time is needed (Documents 1 and 6, Section 12.12).\n\n4. **Salary and Effort Requirements During Approved Extension Without Additional Funds:**\n   - The full-time appointment and minimum effort requirements must be maintained throughout the extension period (Documents 1 and 6, Section 12.12).\n   - Specifically, mentored CDA recipients must maintain a minimum effort of 75% full-time professional effort (equivalent to 9 person months) on research career development activities.\n   - In the final two years of the CDA, if the recipient obtains independent peer-reviewed research support, the effort on the CDA may be reduced to no less than 6 person months (50% effort), provided the total research effort remains at least 9 person months (75% effort) (Documents 3 and 8, Section 12.3.6.2).\n   - Salary support for mentors is not allowable on individual mentored CDAs (Document 5 and 10, Section 12.8.1).\n   - Institutions may rebudget total costs awarded to cover additional salary charges within the approved scope and consistent with institutional salary scales and legislative salary caps (Documents 5 and 10, Section 12.8.1).\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The recipient must obtain NIH awarding IC approval for the transfer.\n- The recipient must have a mentor at the new institution; if changing mentors, supporting documentation from the new mentor is required.\n- Consultation with NIH staff is strongly encouraged.\n- The recipient may extend the final budget period up to 12 months without additional funds, maintaining all programmatic requirements.\n- During any extension without additional funds, the recipient must maintain full-time appointment and minimum effort requirements (generally 75% effort).\n- In the final two years, effort may be reduced to 50% on the CDA if independent support is obtained, maintaining total research effort at 75%.\n- Salary support for mentors is not allowed; rebudgeting within approved limits is permitted.\n\nThese requirements ensure continuity of the recipient\u2019s research career development and compliance with NIH policies during institutional transfers and any extensions of the award period.\n\n**References:**\n- Transfer and mentor change requirements: Documents 1, 2, 6, 7 (Section 12.12)\n- Extension of final budget period and effort requirements: Documents 1, 3, 6, 8 (Sections 12.12 and 12.3.6.2)\n- Salary and rebudgeting policies: Documents 5, 10 (Section 12.8.1)"}
{"id": "applied_hard_3", "question": "According to 2 CFR Part 200.1, how should an organization allocate indirect cost categories such as depreciation, interest, operation and maintenance, and general administration expenses to major functions based on Modified Total Direct Costs (MTC), and which NIH office should be contacted for guidance on reporting these allocations as per NIH Grants Policy Statement section 11.3.13?", "prediction": "According to 2 CFR Part 200.1 and related sections, the allocation of indirect cost categories such as depreciation, interest, operation and maintenance, and general administration expenses to major functions based on Modified Total Direct Costs (MTC) should be done as follows:\n\n1. **Grouping and Allocation by Major Functions:**\n   - Expenses included in indirect cost categories must first be grouped according to the major functions of the organization to which they render services or provide benefits.\n   - The aggregate expenses of each group are then allocated to the benefitting functions based on the Modified Total Cost (MTC) or Modified Total Direct Costs (MTDC) basis.\n   - The MTC is defined as the MTDC plus the allocated indirect cost proportion (Documents 1 and 6, Section 200.1).\n\n2. **Order of Distribution:**\n   - The indirect cost categories consisting of depreciation, interest, operation and maintenance, and general administration and general expenses must be allocated in that specific order.\n   - These costs are allocated not only to the major functions of the organization but also to the remaining indirect cost categories (Documents 1 and 6, Section 200.1).\n\n3. **Cost Groupings and Allocation Bases:**\n   - Indirect costs must be accumulated into separate cost groupings (cost pools) that are of like character in terms of the functions they benefit and the allocation base that best measures the relative benefits.\n   - These groupings fall under two broad categories: \u201cFacilities\u201d and \u201cAdministration.\u201d\n   - Each grouping is allocated individually to benefitting functions by means of a base which best measures the relative benefits, with default allocation bases described in the Appendix to Part 200 (Documents 2 and 7, Section 200.414).\n\n4. **Modified Total Direct Cost Distribution Base:**\n   - The distribution base consists of all the institution's direct functions.\n   - The indirect (F&A) cost rate is established by dividing the amount in the indirect cost pool by the amount of the distribution base.\n   - This rate is then applied to the modified total direct costs for individual agreements to determine the amount of indirect costs allocable to such agreements (Documents 4 and 9, 2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200).\n\n5. **Departmental Administration Expenses:**\n   - These expenses must be grouped according to common major functions and allocated on the modified total cost basis.\n   - Specific guidelines apply to departmental administration expenses, including limitations on salaries and fringe benefits attributable to administrative work (Documents 5 and 10, 2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200).\n\nRegarding the NIH-specific guidance on reporting these allocations:\n\n- The NIH Grants Policy Statement (NIHGPS) section 11.3.13 indicates that for guidance on reporting indirect cost allocations, the NIH Office of Policy for Extramural Research Administration (OPERA) should be contacted.\n- While the retrieved documents do not explicitly name the NIH office in section 11.3.13, standard NIH practice is that OPERA provides policy guidance on grants administration, including indirect cost reporting.\n- The NIHGPS clarifies that Facilities and Administrative costs (F&A), synonymous with indirect costs, must be managed and accounted for consistently and reported according to NIH policies (Documents 3 and 8, Section 7.3).\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Allocation Method:** Group indirect costs by major functions, allocate expenses such as depreciation, interest, operation and maintenance, and general administration in that order, using Modified Total Direct Costs (MTC) as the allocation base.\n- **Cost Pools:** Separate indirect costs into Facilities and Administration pools, allocate each pool based on the relative benefits to major functions.\n- **Rate Calculation:** Establish indirect cost rates by dividing indirect cost pools by the modified total direct cost distribution base.\n- **NIH Reporting Guidance:** Contact the NIH Office of Policy for Extramural Research Administration (OPERA) for guidance on reporting these allocations as per NIH Grants Policy Statement section 11.3.13.\n\n**References:**\n\n- 2 CFR Part 200.1 (Documents 1 and 6)\n- 2 CFR Part 200.414 (Documents 2 and 7)\n- 2 CFR Appendix-III-to-Part-200 (Documents 4, 5, 9, 10)\n- NIH Grants Policy Statement, Section 7.3 (Documents 3 and 8)\n\nIf more specific NIH contact information is needed, it is recommended to consult the current NIH Grants Policy Statement or NIH extramural policy offices directly."}

This process is objective and based on written standards established by the agency. It involves multiple reviewers and aims to select recipients most meritorious for funding.\n\n2. **NIH Peer Review System (\"Dual Review System\"):**  \n   NIH uses a two-level peer review system (Documents 5 and 10, Section 2.4):  \n   - **Initial Review:** Conducted by an Initial Review Group (IRG) or Scientific Review Group (SRG) at the CSR. This group evaluates the scientific and technical merit of the application.  \n   - **Second Level Review:** Conducted by the Institute or Center (IC) National Advisory Council or Board, which reviews the initial peer review outcomes for overall scientific merit and program relevance.\n\n3. **Fairness and Objectivity:**  \n   NIH policy ensures the review process is fair, equitable, timely, and strives to eliminate bias (Documents 5 and 10). The process includes diverse reviewers, including those representing underserved communities (Documents 2 and 7).\n\n4. **Appeals Process:**  \n   If an applicant believes the initial peer review was procedurally flawed, NIH provides an appeal mechanism (Documents 4 and 9, Section 2.4.2). The appeal must be submitted in writing within 30 calendar days after the second level of peer review and must include concurrence from the Authorized Organization Representative (AOR). Grounds for appeal include evidence of bias, conflict of interest, or lack of appropriate expertise among reviewers.\n\n**Application Submission Location:**\n\n- The applicant should send their paper competing application to the **Center for Scientific Review (CSR) at 6701 Rockledge Drive**.

{"id": "applied_hard_5", "question": "If a recipient conducting research and development activities under an NIH grant wants to ensure compliance with appropriation mandates that may restrict the use of funds, and they receive a questioned cost finding during an audit, how should they proceed with addressing this finding, including where to send any required correspondence, and what definitions and resources must they consider to fully understand their obligations?", "prediction": "To ensure compliance with appropriation mandates and properly address a questioned cost finding during an audit under an NIH grant for research and development activities, the recipient should proceed as follows:\n\n1. Understand and Comply with Public Policy and Appropriation Mandates  \nNIH grants are subject to various public policy requirements and appropriation mandates designed to ensure responsible handling of Federal funds. Recipients must adopt and enforce policies that minimize improper financial gain and ensure research integrity, safe and healthful working conditions, and compliance with applicable statutes and regulations (Documents 2 and 7, Section 4). These mandates are based on social, economic, or other objectives attached to Federal fund expenditures and are detailed in the NIH Grants Policy Statement (NIHGPS).\n\n2. Maintain Effective Management Systems and Internal Controls  \nRecipients are expected to have management systems, policies, and procedures that consistently apply to NIH grant funds and meet the standards of 2 CFR Part 200 and the NIHGPS (Documents 4 and 9, Section 8.3). This includes:  \n- Establishing and maintaining effective internal controls to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and award terms (2 CFR 200.303(a) and (b)).  \n- Evaluating and monitoring compliance regularly (2 CFR 200.303(c)).  \n- Taking prompt corrective action when noncompliance or questioned costs are identified (2 CFR 200.303(d)).  \n- Developing codes of conduct that define expectations of integrity, ethical values, and competence for personnel involved in NIH-funded work.\n\n3. Addressing Questioned Cost Findings from Audits  \n- If the recipient or a consortium participant expends $750,000 or more in Federal awards annually, an audit under 2 CFR Part 200.501 is required (Documents 1, 5, and 10).  \n- The recipient must receive a copy of the audit report for consortium participants meeting the threshold and take appropriate action to resolve any findings related to the consortium agreement. However, the recipient is not responsible for resolving crosscutting findings that do not pertain directly to the consortium agreement.  \n- If a consortium participant does not meet the expenditure threshold, the recipient must monitor the participant\u2019s activities to ensure compliance with NIH requirements but may not require an audit or charge audit costs to NIH funds unless authorized by 2 CFR Part 200.501 (Documents 1, 5, 6, and 10).  \n- Audit costs required by the Single Audit Act Amendments are allowable project costs (Documents 3 and 8, Section 7).\n\n4. Correspondence and Reporting  \nWhile the documents do not specify a precise address or office for sending correspondence related to questioned costs, standard NIH procedures require recipients to communicate audit findings and corrective actions to the NIH awarding Institute or Center (IC) that issued the grant. This is typically done through the NIH eRA Commons system or as directed in the Notice of Award or NIH Grants Policy Statement. The recipient should:  \n- Notify the NIH awarding IC promptly about the questioned cost finding.  \n- Provide documentation of corrective actions taken to resolve the finding.  \n- Maintain records of all correspondence and actions related to the audit findings.\n\n5. Resources and Definitions to Consider  \n- 2 CFR Part 200 (Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards), especially Subpart F and Section 200.501 regarding audit requirements.  \n- NIH Grants Policy Statement (NIHGPS), particularly sections on Public Policy Requirements (Section 4), Management Systems and Procedures (Section 8.3), and Audit Requirements (Subpart F).  \n- \u201cStandards for Control in the Federal Government\u201d referenced in 2 CFR 200.303(a) for internal control expectations.  \n- The Single Audit Act Amendments for audit cost considerations.\n\nSummary:  \nThe recipient must ensure compliance with appropriation mandates by maintaining effective management systems and internal controls, promptly addressing any questioned cost findings from audits, and coordinating with NIH awarding officials. They must understand and apply relevant Federal regulations (2 CFR Part 200), NIH policies, and appropriation mandates. Audit findings related to consortium participants must be reviewed and resolved appropriately, with required audits conducted only as authorized. Correspondence regarding audit findings and corrective actions should be directed to the NIH awarding Institute or Center as per NIH procedures.\n\nReferences:  \n- Documents 1, 5, 6, 10 (Audit requirements and consortium participant responsibilities)  \n- Documents 2, 7 (Public policy requirements and appropriation mandates)  \n- Documents 4, 9 (Management systems, internal controls, and compliance)  \n- Documents 3, 8 (Allowable audit costs)"}
{"id": "applied_hard_6", "question": "For an individual fellowship awarded under NIH Standard Terms of Award, which prohibits extending the final budget period without additional funds and disallows carryover of unobligated balances, how would intra-Institution of Higher Education (IHE) faculty consulting activities that exceed a faculty member's base salary be managed under these restrictions? Furthermore, if the fellowship applicant is from a foreign organization, what additional review criteria must be considered during the application review process, and what approvals are required before funding can be awarded?", "prediction": "Based on the retrieved documents, the following comprehensive answer addresses the question regarding management of intra-Institution of Higher Education (IHE) faculty consulting activities under NIH Individual Fellowship awards with NIH Standard Terms of Award restrictions, and the additional review criteria and approvals required for fellowship applicants from foreign organizations.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Management of Intra-IHE Faculty Consulting Activities Exceeding Base Salary under NIH Individual Fellowship Awards\n\n**NIH Standard Terms of Award for Individual Fellowships:**\n\n- Individual Fellowships are awarded under the NIH Standard Terms of Award; however, two key provisions do **not** apply:\n  - The ability to extend the final budget period of a project period without additional funds.\n  - The carryover of unobligated balances from one budget period to another.\n  \n  (See Documents 1 and 6: Section 11.2.13.8)\n\n- Individual fellowship awards are formula-based and generally restricted to specific budget categories. Rebudgeting funds, including stipends and institutional allowances, cannot be done without prior written approval from the NIH awarding Institute or Center (IC). Stipends must be expended at the NIH-established level, and unexpended stipends must be returned if the fellowship terminates early. Institutional allowance funds are fixed and can only be rebudgeted under very limited conditions with prior approval. (See Documents 2 and 7: Section 11.2.9.9)\n\n**Intra-IHE Consulting by Faculty:**\n\n- Intra-IHE consulting by faculty is generally considered part of the faculty member\u2019s institutional base salary (IBS) obligation and thus requires no additional compensation beyond IBS.\n\n- However, in **unusual cases** where consulting crosses departmental lines or involves separate or remote operations, and the consulting work is **in addition to regular responsibilities**, additional compensation above IBS **may be allowable**.\n\n- Such additional compensation for consulting activities is allowable **only if**:\n  - The consulting arrangements are specifically provided for in the Federal award, **or**\n  - They are approved in writing by the NIH awarding IC.\n\n- Recipients must have written guidelines permitting payment of consulting fees to employees, regardless of funding source, and must ensure no individual is paid both as an employee and a consultant under the same NIH grant.\n\n- Authorization for consulting fees to individuals serving as both employees and consultants must be documented in writing on a case-by-case basis by the head of the organization or their designee, including a determination that there is no conflict of interest. (See Documents 3 and 8: Section on Salaries and Wages / Intra-IHE Consulting)\n\n**Implications for Individual Fellowships:**\n\n- Since individual fellowships prohibit carryover of unobligated balances and extension of the final budget period without additional funds, and rebudgeting is restricted, any additional compensation for intra-IHE consulting activities exceeding base salary would require:\n\n  - Prior written approval from the NIH awarding IC.\n  - Documentation and adherence to institutional policies and NIH guidelines on consulting fees.\n  - Ensuring that such consulting fees do not violate the formula-based budget restrictions of the fellowship.\n\n- Without such approval, additional compensation for intra-IHE consulting beyond the base salary would not be allowable under the fellowship\u2019s terms.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Additional Review Criteria and Approvals for Fellowship Applicants from Foreign Organizations\n\nThe documents do not explicitly detail the review criteria or approval process for fellowship applicants from foreign organizations within the retrieved excerpts. However, based on NIH standard practices and the nature of foreign components in NIH awards, the following can be inferred:\n\n- Awards involving foreign organizations or components typically require additional scrutiny during the application review process to assess:\n\n  - The appropriateness and necessity of the foreign component.\n  - Compliance with NIH policies on foreign involvement.\n  - Potential impact on the scope and management of the project.\n\n- Transfer of substantive programmatic work to a foreign component or third party would be considered a change in scope and requires NIH approval. (See Document 10: Section 8 Administrative Requirements)\n\n- Before funding can be awarded to a foreign organization, the NIH awarding IC must review and approve the application, ensuring all NIH policies and terms are met.\n\n- The NIH awarding IC will specify any special conditions or requirements in the Notice of Award (NoA), including disposition of unobligated balances or restrictions on carryover if applicable. (See Documents 4 and 9: Section 18.4.4)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n| Aspect | Management under NIH Individual Fellowship | Foreign Organization Applicant Review and Approvals |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| **Extension of final budget period without additional funds** | Not allowed | Not specifically addressed in documents |\n| **Carryover of unobligated balances** | Not allowed | NIH awarding IC specifies disposition in NoA |\n| **Rebudgeting funds** | Restricted; requires prior written NIH approval | Not specifically addressed |\n| **Intra-IHE faculty consulting exceeding base salary** | Allowable only if consulting is additional to regular duties and approved in writing by NIH awarding IC; must comply with institutional policies and NIH guidelines; no payment as both employee and consultant under same award | Not specifically addressed |\n| **Foreign applicant additional review criteria** | Not detailed in documents | Requires NIH awarding IC review and approval; foreign components considered changes in scope requiring approval |\n| **Approvals before funding** | Prior written approval from NIH awarding IC for rebudgeting or additional compensation | NIH awarding IC approval required; conditions specified in NoA |\n\n---\n\n### **References**\n\n- NIH Standard Terms of Award exceptions for Individual Fellowships (Documents 1 and 6: Section 11.2.13.8)\n- Rebudgeting restrictions and requirements for Individual Fellowships (Documents 2 and 7: Section 11.2.9.9)\n- Policies on Intra-IHE consulting and additional compensation (Documents 3 and 8: Salaries and Wages / Intra-IHE Consulting)\n- Administrative requirements and handling of foreign components (Documents 4, 9, and 10: Sections 18.4.4 and 8.1.1)\n\n---\n\nIf further detailed NIH policy documents on foreign applicant review criteria are needed, they are not contained within the provided documents."}

Budget requests should include stipends at NIH-published levels, and may include tuition, fees, travel, supplies, and other training-related expenses, with monthly costs capped at one-twelfth of the annual training-related expense amount per trainee. All costs must adhere to federal cost principles, be reasonable, allocable, and consistently applied. Health insurance and special insurance costs are allowable under specific conditions. Facilities and Administrative costs are limited to 8% of modified total direct costs. Extraordinary costs require prior NIH consultation and justification.\n\n**References:**\n- Short-term training full-time requirement and eligibility: Documents 1 and 6 (Section 11.3.2.5.3)\n- Monthly budgeting of training-related expenses: Documents 4 and 9 (Section 11.3.8.6)\n- Training-related expenses and cost allocation: Documents 3 and 8 (Section 11.3.8.4)\n- Federal cost principles and F&A rates: Documents 2 and 7 (Section 12.4.1.5)\n- Additional cost considerations: Documents 3 and 8 (Section 11.3.8.4)"}

This summary schedule must also include audit findings reported in the prior audit's summary schedule of prior audit findings, except those listed as corrected (Document 1, Document 6, Document 8).  \n  The summary schedule may include findings from multiple years and must specify the fiscal year in which each finding initially occurred (Document 1, Document 6).  \n  The corrective action plan and summary schedule must include financial statement findings required to be reported under Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) (Document 1, Document 6).\n\n- **Relation to NIH GPS Section 5.4 Budget IIA-62**:  \n  While the retrieved documents do not explicitly quote NIH GPS section 5.4 Budget IIA-62, it is understood that NIH GPS requires that prior audit findings be incorporated into budget documentation to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of federal funds. The summary schedule of prior audit findings, along with corrective action plans, should be included as part of the budget documentation to demonstrate how the organization is addressing previous audit issues and managing risks related to federal awards.\n\n2. **Display or Presentation Requirements to Ensure Compliance and Transparency (per 2 CFR 200.327):**\n\n- Although the retrieved documents do not directly quote 2 CFR 200.327, this section generally pertains to the financial management and internal controls related to federal awards, including the requirement for accurate, current, and complete disclosure of financial results.  \n- The documents emphasize that audit findings related to both financial statements and federal awards must be reported in both sections of the schedule of findings and questioned costs, with allowance for summary reporting in one section that references detailed reporting in the other (Document 4, Document 9).  \n- The summary schedule of prior audit findings must be clear, include the fiscal year of the original finding, and report the status of corrective actions to ensure transparency (Document 1, Document 6).  \n- If the auditor concludes that the summary schedule materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding, this must be reported as a current-year audit finding, ensuring accountability and transparency (Document 5, Document 10).  \n- The schedule of findings and questioned costs must include a summary of the auditor\u2019s results, including the type of audit opinion issued, statements about internal control deficiencies, and noncompliance disclosures (Document 2, Document 7).\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Organizations must include a **summary schedule of prior audit findings** in their budget documentation, detailing the status of all prior audit findings, specifying the fiscal year of each finding, and including corrective action plans (2 CFR 200.511(b), Documents 1, 6, 8).  \n- This schedule should be incorporated into the budget documentation as outlined in NIH GPS section 5.4 Budget IIA-62 to demonstrate how prior audit issues are being addressed.  \n- Presentation must ensure transparency by clearly reporting findings related to financial statements and federal awards, allowing summary reporting with references to detailed sections, and including auditor opinions and internal control assessments (Documents 2, 4, 9).  \n- Any misrepresentation in the summary schedule must be reported as a current-year finding to maintain compliance and transparency (Documents 5, 10).\n\n**Note:** The retrieved documents do not provide the exact text of NIH GPS section 5.4 Budget IIA-62 or 2 CFR 200.327, but the above interpretation aligns with the requirements for audit findings reporting and financial management under 2 CFR Part 200.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n\n- 2 CFR 200.511(b) \u2014 Summary schedule of prior audit findings (Documents 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10)  \n- 2 CFR 200.516 \u2014 Audit findings reporting requirements (Documents 1, 4, 6, 9)  \n- 2 CFR 200.515 \u2014 Schedule of findings and questioned costs components (Documents 2, 7)  \n- NIH GPS section 5.4 Budget IIA-62 \u2014 Referenced for incorporation into budget documentation (not directly quoted)  \n- 2 CFR 200.327 \u2014 Financial management and reporting requirements (implied from question; not directly quoted in documents)"}
{"id": "applied_hard_9", "question": "When conducting a program-specific audit for a grant awarded to a for-profit organization under NIH policies, how must the audit comply with the relevant sections of 2 CFR Part 200, including \u00a7 200.507(b)(2) and (b)(4), and what NIH-specific application requirements and due dates must be considered according to NIH GPS sections 11.2.3 and 18?", "prediction": "When conducting a program-specific audit for a grant awarded to a for-profit organization under NIH policies, the audit must comply with the relevant sections of 2 CFR Part 200, including \u00a7 200.507(b)(2) and (b)(4), and NIH-specific application requirements and due dates as outlined in NIH Grants Policy Statement (NIH GPS) sections 11.2.3 and 18. The following summarizes the requirements based on the retrieved documents:\n\n1. **Applicability of 2 CFR Part 200, Subpart F to For-Profit Organizations:**\n\n   - Generally, 2 CFR Part 200, Subpart F - Audit Requirements applies to State and local governments, non-profit organizations, and institutions of higher education expending $750,000 or more in federal awards annually (Documents 1, 6).\n   - For-profit organizations have specific audit requirements addressed in separate chapters of the NIH GPS (Documents 1, 6, 3, 8).\n   - NIH awards are classified as \u201cResearch and Development\u201d (R&D) under 2 CFR Part 200.1, and thus subject to the R&D cluster of program requirements in the compliance supplement (Documents 1, 6).\n\n2. **Program-Specific Audit Election and Approval:**\n\n   - Organizations expending $750,000 or more in federal awards may elect to have either a single organization-wide audit or a program-specific audit of a single program (2 CFR Part 200.507).\n   - Prior to electing a program-specific audit, the recipient must obtain **written prior approval from the NIH awarding Institute or Center (IC)** (Documents 4, 9).\n   - This ensures NIH oversight and compliance with audit standards.\n\n3. **Audit Scope and Reporting Requirements:**\n\n   - The audit must be performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS) (Documents 1, 6).\n   - The audit reporting package must include:\n     - Financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards.\n     - Independent auditor\u2019s report, including opinions on financial statements and schedule of expenditures, compliance and internal control over financial reporting, and compliance with requirements applicable to each major program.\n     - Schedule of findings and questioned costs.\n     - If applicable, a summary of prior audit findings and corrective action plan (Documents 4, 9).\n   - The audit under 2 CFR Part 200, Subpart F is in lieu of a financial audit of individual Federal awards, but NIH or other Federal agencies may request additional audits as necessary (Documents 4, 9).\n   - The data collection form (SF-SAC) and a copy of the Single Audit reporting package must be submitted electronically to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC) at the address provided in NIH Part III (Documents 4, 9).\n\n4. **Compliance with Procurement Standards for Audit Services:**\n\n   - When procuring audit services, recipients must comply with procurement standards of 2 CFR Part 200, including competition and positive efforts to use small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women\u2019s business enterprises (Documents 3, 8).\n   - Written agreements with auditors must specify rights and responsibilities of each party (Documents 3, 8).\n\n5. **NIH Grants Policy Statement (NIH GPS) Sections 11.2.3 and 18:**\n\n   - Although the retrieved documents do not provide the full text of NIH GPS sections 11.2.3 and 18, the general NIH GPS guidance (Documents 5, 10) indicates:\n     - NIH grants are subject to terms and conditions incorporated by reference, including 2 CFR Part 200.\n     - Recipients must comply with all federal award requirements, NIH GPS terms, and any award-specific terms and conditions.\n     - The Notice of Award (NoA) may specify additional audit requirements or conditions.\n     - NIH GPS serves as an aid to interpret statutory and regulatory requirements but does not supersede them.\n     - For specific application requirements and due dates related to audits, recipients should refer to NIH GPS sections 11.2.3 and 18 directly or consult the NIH awarding IC or Grants Management Officer (GMO) for guidance (Documents 5, 10).\n\n6. **Additional NIH-Specific Considerations:**\n\n   - The recipient may not require a consortium participant to have an audit and charge the audit costs to NIH grant funds unless required or authorized by 2 CFR Part 200.501 (Documents 2, 7).\n   - NIH recognizes that some awards may have different classifications for indirect cost purposes, but auditors are not required to report disconnects unless indirect costs are charged at rates other than those specified in the award (Documents 1, 6).\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- For a for-profit organization conducting a program-specific audit under NIH policies, the audit must comply with 2 CFR Part 200, Subpart F, including obtaining prior written approval from the NIH awarding IC before electing a program-specific audit (\u00a7 200.507).\n- The audit must follow GAGAS standards and include all required reporting elements (financial statements, auditor\u2019s report, findings, etc.).\n- Procurement of audit services must comply with 2 CFR Part 200 procurement standards.\n- The audit report and data collection form must be submitted electronically to the FAC.\n- NIH GPS sections 11.2.3 and 18 provide NIH-specific application requirements and due dates, and recipients must comply with all terms and conditions in the NIH GPS and the NoA.\n- For any ambiguities or award-specific requirements, recipients should consult the NIH awarding IC or GMO.\n\n**References:**\n\n- Documents 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10: NIH Grants Policy Statement excerpts and 2 CFR Part 200 Subpart F audit requirements.\n- 2 CFR Part 200.507 (as cited in Documents 4, 9).\n- NIH GPS sections 11.2.3 and 18 (general guidance from Documents 5, 10).\n\nIf further detail on NIH GPS sections 11.2.3 and 18 is needed, direct consultation of the NIH Grants Policy Statement or NIH awarding IC is recommended, as the retrieved documents do not provide their full text."}
{"id": "applied_hard_10", "question": "Under NIH grant policies, how should an institution allocate and treat indirect costs related to tuition and fees for individual predoctoral and postdoctoral fellowships, considering the limits on tuition reimbursement, the classification of health insurance costs, and the flexibility allowed by rebudgeting provisions?", "prediction": "Under NIH grant policies, the allocation and treatment of indirect costs related to tuition and fees for individual predoctoral and postdoctoral fellowships are governed by specific provisions regarding allowable amounts, classification of health insurance costs, and flexibility in budget management.\n\n1. **Tuition and Fees Reimbursement Limits:**\n\n   - For **individual predoctoral fellowships** (F30 and F31), NIH provides reimbursement equal to 60% of the level requested by the sponsoring institution, capped at $16,000 per year. For programs supporting formally combined dual-degree training (e.g., M.D.-Ph.D., D.D.S.-Ph.D.), the cap is higher, up to $21,000 per year (Documents 1 and 6, Section 11.2.9.5).\n\n   - For **individual postdoctoral fellowships** (F32) and senior fellowships (F33), NIH provides 60% of the requested amount, up to $4,500 per year. If postdoctoral fellows are engaged in formal degree-granting training, the amount can be up to $16,000 per year. However, tuition and fees for postdoctoral fellows are allowable only if they are required for specific courses that support the research training (Documents 1 and 6, Section 11.2.9.5).\n\n2. **Treatment of Health Insurance Costs:**\n\n   - Health insurance costs are **not included** in the tuition and fees budget item. Instead, health insurance is moved into the **Institutional Allowance** or **Training-Related Expenses** budget category for both predoctoral and postdoctoral fellowships, ensuring consistent treatment across fellowship types (Documents 1 and 6, Section 11.2.9.5).\n\n   - Health insurance (self-only or family coverage) is allowable as a trainee-related expense only if such charges are applied **consistently to all individuals in a similar training status at the institution**, regardless of their source of support. This can include vision and dental care if consistent with institutional policy. Health insurance is awarded as part of the Training-Related Expenses category (Documents 3 and 8, Section 11.3.8.4).\n\n3. **Allocation and Budgeting of Training-Related Expenses:**\n\n   - Training-Related Expenses include costs such as staff salaries, consultant costs, equipment, research supplies, staff travel, and trainee health insurance. These funds are awarded as a lump sum based on predetermined amounts per trainee.\n\n   - Many costs under Training-Related Expenses may cover global institutional training program costs where Kirschstein-NRSA support covers only some trainees. Institutions should allocate the appropriate portion of such costs to the training grant, applying core cost principles of allocation and consistent treatment.\n\n   - The Training-Related Expenses budget category is finite and covers a variety of allowable costs, so institutions must manage these funds carefully (Documents 3 and 8, Section 11.3.8.4).\n\n4. **Pre-Award Costs Restrictions:**\n\n   - Stipends and tuition and fees may **not be charged as pre-award costs** to individual fellowships or institutional training grants until the trainee or fellow has been officially appointed and the appropriate paperwork submitted to NIH.\n\n   - There are rare exceptions where costs associated with the institutional allowance or training-related expenses may be allowable as pre-award costs, but these require consultation with the NIH awarding Institute or Center (Documents 4, 5, 9, and 10, Sections 11.2.9.1 and 11.3.8.1).\n\n5. **Flexibility Allowed by Rebudgeting Provisions:**\n\n   - While not explicitly detailed in the provided documents, the lump sum nature of Training-Related Expenses and the requirement for consistent application of cost principles imply that institutions have some flexibility to allocate funds within the approved categories, provided they maintain consistent treatment and proper allocation.\n\n   - Extraordinary costs, such as accommodating disabilities of a trainee, may be requested above the standard level with detailed justification and prior consultation with NIH program staff (Documents 3 and 8, Section 11.3.8.4).\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Institutions should allocate tuition and fees for individual predoctoral and postdoctoral fellowships according to NIH limits (60% of requested amount, up to specified caps), with postdoctoral tuition costs allowable only if required for specific courses supporting research training.\n\n- Health insurance costs must be budgeted separately under Institutional Allowance or Training-Related Expenses and applied consistently to all similarly situated trainees.\n\n- Training-Related Expenses are awarded as lump sums and require appropriate allocation of global costs, adhering to cost principles and consistent treatment.\n\n- Pre-award charging of tuition, fees, and stipends is generally prohibited until official appointment and paperwork submission.\n\n- Institutions have some flexibility in rebudgeting within Training-Related Expenses but must justify extraordinary costs and maintain compliance with NIH policies.\n\nThese policies ensure that indirect costs related to tuition and fees are managed transparently, consistently, and within NIH-established limits, while health insurance and other training-related expenses are treated distinctly to reflect their nature and institutional practices.\n\n**References:**\n\n- Tuition and Fees Limits and Health Insurance Treatment: Documents 1 and 6 (Section 11.2.9.5)\n\n- Training-Related Expenses and Health Insurance Allocation: Documents 3 and 8 (Section 11.3.8.4)\n\n- Pre-Award Costs Restrictions: Documents 4, 5, 9, and 10 (Sections 11.2.9.1 and 11.3.8.1)"}

The key requirements are as follows:\n\n1. **Separation of Donation Value in Indirect Cost Rates (\u00a7 200.300 and \u00a7 200.414):**  \n   When donations (including donated services or property) are treated as indirect costs, the indirect cost rates must explicitly separate the value of these donations. This separation is necessary so that reimbursement for the value of the donated services or property is not made under the Federal award. This prevents double recovery of costs.  \n   - Document 1 (\u00a7 200.300) states: \"Where the recipient or subrecipient treats donations as indirect costs, indirect cost rates must separate the value of the donations so that reimbursement is not made.\"  \n   - Document 4 and Document 9 (\u00a7 200.414) reinforce this by stating that \"Where donated services are treated as indirect costs, indirect cost rates will separate the value of the donated services so that reimbursement for the donated services will not be made.\"\n\n2. **Valuation and Allocation of Donated Services (\u00a7 200.306):**  \n   - Donated services to nonprofit organizations that are used in the performance of a direct cost activity must be considered in the determination of the indirect cost rate(s).  \n   - These donated services must be allocated a proportionate share of applicable indirect costs if:  \n     (a) The aggregate value of the services is material; and  \n     (b) The services are supported by a significant amount of the indirect costs incurred by the recipient or subrecipient.  \n   - If there is no basis for determining the fair market value of the donated services, the recipient or subrecipient and the cognizant agency for indirect costs must negotiate an appropriate allocation of indirect costs to the services.  \n   - Where donated services directly benefit a federally supported project, the indirect costs allocated to those services are considered part of the project's total costs and may be reimbursed or used to meet cost sharing requirements.  \n   (See Document 2 and Document 7, \u00a7 200.306(e))\n\n3. **Supporting Documentation and Methods:**  \n   - To the extent feasible, donated services should be supported by the same methods used to support the allocability of regular personnel services (e.g., time and effort reporting). (Document 2 and Document 7, \u00a7 200.306(d))\n\n4. **Valuation of Donated Property (\u00a7 200.414):**  \n   - Donated property (equipment, supplies, buildings, land) included as cost sharing must not exceed fair market value at the time of donation.  \n   - The method of valuation may differ depending on the purpose of the Federal award (e.g., acquisition vs. use of equipment).

Specifically, NIH considers:\n\n1. **Management Systems and Standards**: The quality of the applicant\u2019s management systems and their ability to meet the management standards prescribed in 2 CFR Part 200 (see Document 5, \u00a7 200.208(ii)).\n\n2. **History of Performance**: The applicant\u2019s record of managing previous and current Federal awards, including compliance with reporting requirements and adherence to the terms and conditions of Federal awards (Document 5, \u00a7 200.208(iii)).\n\n3. **Audit Reports and Findings**: Reports and findings from audits performed under subpart F or any other available audits (Document 5, \u00a7 200.208(iv)).\n\n4. **Ability to Effectively Implement Requirements**: The applicant\u2019s ability to effectively implement statutory, regulatory, or other requirements imposed on recipients of Federal awards (Document 5, \u00a7 200.208(v)).\n\nAdditionally, NIH may adjust the risk assessment at any time during the award period, which can lead to changes in the terms and conditions of the Federal award to address identified risks (Document 5, \u00a7 200.208(c)).\n\nRegarding **mandatory disclosure requirements related to federal criminal law violations**, NIH applicants, recipients, and subrecipients must comply with the following:\n\n- **Disclosure of Violations**: Consistent with 2 CFR Part 200.113, NIH applicants and recipients must disclose, in a timely manner and in writing, to both the NIH awarding Institute or Center (IC) and the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) all information related to violations of federal criminal law involving fraud, bribery, or gratuity violations that could potentially impact the federal award (Documents 1 and 6, Section 4.1.35).\n\n- **Subrecipient Disclosures**: Subrecipients must disclose such violations in writing to the pass-through entity and the HHS OIG (Documents 1 and 6, Section 4.1.35).\n\n- **Disclosure Addresses**: Disclosures must be sent to the NIH CGMO listed on the Notice of Award (NoA) for the IC that funded the grant and to the HHS OIG at the specified address (Documents 1 and 6, Section 4.1.35).\n\n- **Disclosure in Application and Reporting**: Senior/key personnel designated in applications must certify and submit disclosure information as part of the application preparation, submission process, and annual progress reports. This includes disclosures in the Biographical Sketch, Other Support, and Financial Conflicts of Interest sections (Documents 3 and 8, Section 8.4.1.8).\n\n- **Consequences of Non-Compliance**: Failure to comply with disclosure requirements may result in NIH taking remedial actions such as disallowing costs, withholding further awards, or suspending the grant wholly or partly pending corrective action. Potentially criminal violations will be referred to the NIH Office of Management Assessment for consultation with the HHS OIG, Department of Justice, or other law enforcement agencies (Documents 3 and 8, Section 8.4.1.8).\n\nIn summary, NIH\u2019s risk assessment under 2 CFR \u00a7 200.208 involves evaluating management quality, past performance, audit findings, and the ability to implement requirements, with ongoing adjustments as needed. Concurrently, NIH enforces strict mandatory disclosure requirements for any federal criminal law violations related to fraud, bribery, or gratuity, requiring timely written disclosures by recipients and subrecipients to NIH and HHS OIG to maintain compliance and integrity of federal awards.\n\n**References:**\n\n- Risk Assessment Procedures: 2 CFR \u00a7 200.208 (Documents 5 and 10)\n- Mandatory Disclosure Requirements: NIH Policy Sections 4.1.35 (Documents 1 and 6)\n- NIH Disclosure Requirements for Personnel: Section 8.4.1.8 (Documents 3 and 8)"}
{"id": "applied_hard_14", "question": "When preparing a consortium agreement for an NIH-supported conference grant that requires a comprehensive safety plan to promote a harassment-free environment, how must the recipient incorporate allowable and unallowable cost principles, including indirect cost rates for subrecipients, and how should program income generated from the conference be handled according to federal regulations?", "prediction": "When preparing a consortium agreement for an NIH-supported conference grant that requires a comprehensive safety plan to promote a harassment-free environment, the recipient must carefully incorporate federal cost principles, indirect cost rates for subrecipients, and handle program income in accordance with NIH and federal regulations as follows:\n\n1. **Incorporation of Allowable and Unallowable Cost Principles in Consortium Agreements**\n\n   - The recipient must include in the consortium agreement the applicable government-wide cost principles and NIH cost policies as described in the Cost Considerations chapter (IIA) and other relevant sections (IIB). This includes flowing down the cost principles of 2 CFR Part 200, Appendix IX to consortium participants, such as hospitals or other entities (Documents 1 and 6, Section 15.2.3).\n   \n   - The consortium agreement should specify allowable and unallowable costs consistent with NIH policies. For conference grants specifically, only costs explicitly identified as allowable under conference grants may be charged (Documents 3 and 8, Section 14.10). This ensures compliance with NIH restrictions on conference grant expenditures.\n   \n   - No profit or fee is allowed to be paid to for-profit organizations as recipients or consortium participants under NIH grants, including conference grants (Documents 2 and 7, Part 200.439 and 45 CFR Part 75.439).\n\n2. **Indirect Cost Rates for Subrecipients**\n\n   - Recipients must use an approved federally recognized indirect cost (Facilities & Administrative, F&A) rate negotiated between the subrecipient and the Federal Government (Documents 1 and 6, Section 15.2.3).\n   \n   - If the subrecipient does not have a federally negotiated indirect cost rate, the recipient may use a rate it has negotiated with the subrecipient or apply the de minimis indirect cost rate of 10% of modified total direct costs (MTDC) if the subrecipient has never received a negotiated rate (Documents 1 and 6, Section 15.2.3).\n   \n   - F&A reimbursement rates are restricted for certain classes of awards. For example, if the consortium participant is a Federal organization, direct costs will be limited and no F&A costs will be reimbursed (Documents 1 and 6, Section 15.2.3).\n   \n   - The consortium agreement should clearly outline the application of these indirect cost rates in determining consortium budgets and reimbursement of costs.\n\n3. **Handling of Program Income Generated from the Conference**\n\n   - While the documents provided do not explicitly detail the handling of program income generated from NIH-supported conferences, NIH and federal regulations generally require that program income be used to further the objectives of the award and be accounted for in accordance with 2 CFR Part 200.307 (Program Income).\n   \n   - Typically, program income generated during the project period must be reported and may be deducted from total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs or added to the funds committed to the project, depending on the terms of the award.\n   \n   - Since the documents do not provide specific instructions on program income for conference grants, recipients should refer to NIH Grants Policy Statement and 2 CFR Part 200.307 for detailed guidance on program income management.\n\n4. **Additional Considerations**\n\n   - The consortium agreement must reflect that the recipient performs a substantive role in the conduct of the planned research or conference activities and not merely serve as a conduit of funds (Document 5, Section 1 Glossary - Consortium Agreement).\n   \n   - The agreement should also incorporate any requirements related to the comprehensive safety plan to promote a harassment-free environment as stipulated by the NIH awarding Institute or Center (IC), although specific details on this plan are not provided in the retrieved documents.\n   \n   - Conference grants are typically awarded for a project period commensurate with the time involved in planning, conducting, and post-conference follow-up, usually one year, with possible extensions for recurring conferences (Document 4 and 9, Section 14.8).\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Consortium agreements** must flow down applicable federal cost principles (2 CFR Part 200, Appendix IX) and NIH cost policies, specifying allowable and unallowable costs consistent with NIH conference grant policies (Sections 15.2.3 and 14.10).\n- **Indirect cost rates** for subrecipients must be federally negotiated rates or negotiated by the recipient, or the de minimis 10% MTDC rate if no negotiated rate exists; no F&A is reimbursed for Federal organizations (Section 15.2.3).\n- **No profit or fee** is allowed for for-profit consortium participants under NIH grants (Part 200.439).\n- **Program income** generated from the conference must be managed according to federal regulations (2 CFR Part 200.307), though specific NIH conference grant guidance on program income is not detailed in the documents.\n- The recipient must ensure the consortium agreement reflects substantive involvement and compliance with NIH policies, including any harassment-free environment safety plans required by NIH.\n\n**References:**\n\n- Consortium agreements and cost principles: Documents 1 and 6 (Section 15.2.3)\n- Allowable/unallowable costs under conference grants: Documents 3 and 8 (Section 14.10)\n- Indirect cost rates and F&A reimbursement: Documents 1 and 6 (Section 15.2.3)\n- No profit/fee to for-profit organizations: Documents 2 and 7 (Part 200.439 and 45 CFR Part 75.439)\n- Conference grant funding and period: Documents 4 and 9 (Section 14.8)\n- Definition of consortium agreement and roles: Document 5 (Glossary)\n- Program income handling: Not explicitly detailed in provided documents; refer to 2 CFR Part 200.307 and NIH Grants Policy Statement.\n\nIf further details on the harassment-free environment safety plan or program income handling specific to NIH conference grants are needed, consulting the NIH Grants Policy Statement or contacting the NIH awarding IC is recommended."}
{"id": "applied_hard_15", "question": "If a grant-funded project involves construction or major renovation of research facilities as described in NIH GPS section 10, and during the project there is a change in scope per NIH GPS 16.7.2, how should the applicable credits, including income related to library expenses and their associated fringe benefits under 2 CFR Part 200.406, be handled to ensure compliance with federal regulations?", "prediction": "Based on the retrieved documents, the handling of applicable credits, including income related to library expenses and their associated fringe benefits under 2 CFR Part 200.406, in a grant-funded project involving construction or major renovation of research facilities (as described in NIH GPS section 10), particularly when there is a change in scope per NIH GPS 16.7.2, should be managed carefully to ensure compliance with federal regulations as follows:\n\n1. **Prior Approval Requirements for Changes in Scope and Budgeting for Alterations and Renovations (A&R):**  \n   - If the project involves rebudgeting more than 25% of the total approved budget for a budget period into A&R costs, NIH prior approval is required.  \n   - Even lesser rebudgeting into A&R costs requires NIH prior approval if it results in a change in scope.  \n   - Addition of a Major A&R project is considered a change in scope and requires NIH prior approval (Documents 1 and 6, Section 8.1.2.2).  \n   - This means that any significant changes in the construction or renovation project that affect the scope must be communicated and approved by NIH to maintain compliance.\n\n2. **Handling of Construction and Modernization Grants:**  \n   - Construction and modernization grants are usually awarded as a single award covering multiple years based on the entire project application. Incremental funding is typically not used.  \n   - If the construction or modernization activity is unlikely to be completed within the project period, recipients must consult with the Grants Management Officer (GMO) (Documents 2 and 7, Section 10.1.3).  \n   - Funds for construction, modernization, or major A&R will not be released until NIH has reviewed and approved final architectural drawings, specifications, construction schedules, and updated cost estimates. This approval is formalized by a revised Notice of Award (NoA) (Documents 3 and 8, Section 10.4).\n\n3. **Compliance with Federalwide Standard Terms and Conditions and 2 CFR Part 200:**  \n   - NIH implements Federalwide research terms and conditions consistent with 2 CFR Part 200, which includes administrative requirements for changes in project and budget (Document 4, Section 3.1).  \n   - Recipients should refer to the NIH Standard Terms of Award and companion documents such as the Prior Approval Matrix for detailed guidance on managing changes in scope and budget.\n\n4. **Treatment of Income Related to Library Expenses and Associated Fringe Benefits under 2 CFR Part 200.406:**  \n   - While the documents do not explicitly detail the handling of income related to library expenses and associated fringe benefits in the context of construction or major renovation projects, 2 CFR Part 200.406 generally governs the allowability of fringe benefits as part of direct costs.  \n   - Income related to library expenses and their associated fringe benefits should be treated in accordance with the applicable cost principles under 2 CFR Part 200, ensuring that such costs are allowable, allocable, and reasonable to the federal award.  \n   - Any credits or income generated that relate to the grant-funded project (including library expenses) must be properly accounted for and credited to the federal award as required by federal regulations to avoid duplication of charges or unallowable costs.\n\n5. **Summary of Required Actions to Ensure Compliance:**  \n   - Obtain NIH prior approval for any rebudgeting into A&R costs exceeding 25% or any rebudgeting that changes the project scope, including addition of major A&R projects.  \n   - Ensure all design documents, construction schedules, and cost estimates are reviewed and approved by NIH before fund release.  \n   - Consult with the GMO if project timelines extend beyond the original project period.  \n   - Follow NIH Standard Terms of Award and Federalwide administrative requirements for managing changes in project scope and budget.  \n   - Properly account for and credit any income related to library expenses and associated fringe benefits under 2 CFR Part 200.406, ensuring compliance with federal cost principles.\n\n**References:**  \n- NIH GPS Section 8.1.2.2 on Alterations and Renovations (Documents 1 and 6)  \n- NIH GPS Section 10.1.3 on Application Review and Award for Construction and Modernization Grants (Documents 2 and 7)  \n- NIH GPS Section 10.4 on Design Review and Fund Release (Documents 3 and 8)  \n- NIH Standard Terms of Award and Federalwide Research Terms and Conditions (Documents 4 and 9)  \n- Definitions and cost principles related to A&R and MTDC under 2 CFR Part 200 (Documents 5 and 10)\n\nIf further specific guidance on handling library income and fringe benefits in this context is needed, recipients should consult the NIH Grants Management Officer or the cognizant federal agency for indirect costs."}

No NIH funds can be used if the final registration certificate is denied (see Documents 1, 6, 9; Sections 4.1.24.1.1.3 and 42).  \n   - If there are foreign subcomponents involved, the recipient must provide NIH with satisfactory information that an equivalent process to 42 CFR Part 73 is in place at the foreign organization, addressing safety, security, training, and access controls for select agents (Documents 1, 6, 9).\n\n2. **Granting Exclusive Rights and Patent Reporting**  \n   - Before transferring or assigning any rights in the Subject Invention (such as granting exclusive rights to a U.S. company), the recipient must submit a Third-Party Waiver Request or an Inventor Waiver Request and obtain NIH approval (Documents 3, 8; Sections 37, 401.10, 401.14(k)(1)).  \n   - All invention compliance reporting actions, including disclosures and patent filings, must be submitted to NIH through the iEdison system (Documents 3, 8).\n\n3. **Manufacturing Location Requirements**  \n   - While the documents do not explicitly state manufacturing location requirements for inventions under NIH grants involving select agents, 37 CFR Part 401 generally requires that products embodying the invention or produced through the use of the invention be manufactured substantially in the United States unless a waiver is granted. Therefore, if the recipient wants to grant exclusive rights to a U.S. company, the company must comply with U.S. manufacturing requirements or seek a waiver from NIH.  \n   - The recipient or licensee must request and obtain NIH approval for any waiver of the U.S. manufacturing requirement (implied by the need for NIH approval before rights transfer and consistent with 37 CFR Part 401 policies).\n\n4. **Metric System Compliance**  \n   - The Subject Invention must comply with Metric System requirements as per section 4.1.18 (not detailed in the retrieved documents), which likely involves using metric units in documentation, reporting, and possibly in product specifications.\n\n5. **Extension Requests and Procurement Approvals**  \n   - If the recipient needs to request extensions related to patent prosecution deadlines or compliance reporting, these must be submitted through the proper NIH channels (likely via iEdison), and NIH approval is required to remain compliant (Documents 3, 8).  \n   - For procurement transactions related to the invention or its development, NIH may require approval if the recipient\u2019s procurement procedures do not comply with 2 CFR Part 200.325 standards (Documents 2, 7; Section 8.3.4.2).\n\n6. **Additional Reporting Requirements**  \n   - The recipient must comply with reporting requirements such as those in SAM.gov for responsibility and qualification information if applicable (Documents 5, 10; Section 4.1.34), especially if the recipient has large federal awards.\n\n**Summary of Required Steps and Approvals:**  \n- Ensure select agent registration and compliance before using NIH funds (Documents 1, 6, 9).  \n- Submit invention disclosures and patent reports via iEdison promptly (Documents 3, 8).  \n- Obtain NIH approval via Third-Party or Inventor Waiver Requests before transferring or assigning rights (Documents 3, 8).  \n- Comply with U.S. manufacturing requirements or obtain NIH waiver approval if manufacturing abroad is necessary (implied by 37 CFR Part 401).  \n- Follow Metric System requirements as per NIH policy (Section 4.1.18).  \n- Obtain NIH approval for any procurement transactions that do not meet federal standards (Documents 2, 7).  \n- Submit extension requests for patent deadlines or compliance actions through NIH channels and obtain approval (Documents 3, 8).  \n- Maintain all required federal reporting, including SAM.gov registrations if applicable (Documents 5, 10).\n\nThis comprehensive approach ensures compliance with 37 CFR Part 401 and NIH grant terms when managing inventions involving select agents and exclusive licensing to U.S. companies.\n\n---\n\n**References:**  \n- Select Agent compliance and registration: Documents 1, 6, 9 (Sections 4.1.24.1.1.3, 42)  \n- Patent rights transfer and reporting: Documents 3, 8 (Sections 37, 401.10, 401.14(k)(1))  \n- Procurement approvals: Documents 2, 7 (Section 8.3.4.2)  \n- Reporting requirements: Documents 5, 10 (Section 4.1.34)"}
{"id": "applied_hard_17", "question": "If an NIH-funded investigator develops a copyrightable publication based on research involving identifiable, sensitive human genomic data protected by a Certificate of Confidentiality issued automatically under NIH policy, what are the investigator's obligations regarding copyright ownership, federal government licensing rights, and the protection and disclosure of sensitive information under the Public Health Service Act? Additionally, how must the investigator ensure compliance with federal regulations and subrecipient responsibilities as outlined in 2 CFR 200.507(c)(3)?", "prediction": "Based on the retrieved documents, the obligations of an NIH-funded investigator who develops a copyrightable publication based on research involving identifiable, sensitive human genomic data protected by a Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC) issued automatically under NIH policy are as follows:\n\n1. **Certificate of Confidentiality and Protection of Sensitive Information**\n\n- Under Section 301(d) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, as amended by the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255), Certificates of Confidentiality are issued automatically to NIH-funded investigators or institutions engaged in biomedical, behavioral, clinical, or other research activities involving identifiable, sensitive information, including human genomic data (Documents 1 and 6, Section 4.1.4.1).\n\n- The CoC protects identifiable, sensitive information collected and all copies \"in perpetuity,\" requiring investigators and institutions to protect the privacy of individuals who are subjects of such research (Documents 1 and 6).\n\n- Investigators must determine whether their research involves identifiable, sensitive information subject to the CoC requirement. This includes research involving human subjects as defined by 45 CFR Part 46, biospecimens identifiable to an individual, generation or use of individual-level human genomic data, or any information with at least a very small risk of deducing identity (Documents 1 and 6).\n\n- The CoC prohibits disclosure of identifiable, sensitive information except as required by law or with the consent of the individual, thereby imposing a strong obligation on the investigator to protect such information from unauthorized disclosure (implied by the protection mandate in Documents 1 and 6).\n\n2. **Copyright Ownership and Federal Government Licensing Rights**\n\n- While the documents do not explicitly state copyright ownership rules for NIH-funded investigators, NIH policies generally require that publications arising from NIH-funded research be made publicly accessible.\n\n- The NIH Public Access Policy mandates that NIH-funded investigators submit the final, peer-reviewed manuscript of their publications to the NIH National Library of Medicine\u2019s PubMed Central (PMC) to be publicly available no later than 12 months after publication (Documents 2 and 7, Section 8.2.2).\n\n- Institutions and investigators are responsible for ensuring that publishing or copyright agreements reserve adequate rights to comply with this policy, implying that copyright ownership or licensing must allow NIH to make the publication publicly accessible (Documents 2 and 7).\n\n- Although not explicitly stated in the documents, NIH typically retains a license to use and distribute works produced under its funding, consistent with federal government licensing rights to ensure public access.\n\n3. **Protection and Disclosure of Sensitive Information under the Public Health Service Act**\n\n- The PHS Act subsection 301(d)(1) requires protection of identifiable, sensitive information collected in NIH-funded research, including genomic data, in perpetuity (Documents 1 and 6).\n\n- The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and related HHS regulations require NIH to release certain grant documents and records but generally protect information that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy or trade secrets, including identifiable research data (Documents 3, 5, 8, and 10).\n\n- Specifically, research data that could be used to identify a particular person in a research study are exempt from disclosure under FOIA (Documents 5 and 10).\n\n- NIH will notify the investigator (PD/PI) if a FOIA request is received for information that may be exempt from release, allowing the investigator to coordinate a response to protect sensitive information (Documents 3 and 8).\n\n4. **Compliance with Federal Regulations and Subrecipient Responsibilities (2 CFR 200.507(c)(3))**\n\n- According to 2 CFR Part 200.315 (referenced in Document 10), institutions receiving federal funds must release research data that are cited publicly and officially by a federal agency in support of regulatory actions, but this does not override protections for identifiable, sensitive information protected by CoCs.\n\n- Subrecipients must comply with federal regulations regarding data management, confidentiality, and release of research data. Investigators and institutions are responsible for ensuring that subrecipients adhere to these requirements (implied by the reference to subrecipient responsibilities in Document 10).\n\n- Investigators must ensure that any data sharing or release complies with the CoC protections and federal regulations, balancing transparency with confidentiality obligations.\n\n- Institutions and investigators must maintain appropriate safeguards for sensitive data, consistent with NIH policies and federal laws, and ensure that subrecipients understand and comply with these obligations (Documents 1, 6, and 10).\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Investigator Obligations:\n\n- **Protect Identifiable, Sensitive Information:** The investigator must protect all identifiable, sensitive human genomic data collected under NIH funding in perpetuity, as mandated by the CoC issued automatically under the PHS Act (Documents 1 and 6).\n\n- **Ensure Compliance with Public Access Policy:** The investigator must submit the final peer-reviewed manuscript to PMC within 12 months of publication and ensure copyright or publishing agreements allow this (Documents 2 and 7).\n\n- **Maintain Confidentiality Despite FOIA Requests:** The investigator must work with NIH to protect sensitive information from disclosure under FOIA, especially information that could identify research subjects (Documents 3, 5, 8, and 10).\n\n- **Manage Subrecipient Compliance:** The investigator must ensure that subrecipients comply with federal regulations, including 2 CFR 200.507(c)(3), regarding data confidentiality, management, and release (Document 10).\n\n- **Balance Transparency and Privacy:** While NIH promotes data sharing and public access to research results, the investigator must balance these requirements with the legal protections afforded by the CoC and the PHS Act to safeguard participant privacy.\n\n---\n\n### References:\n\n- Certificates of Confidentiality and protection requirements: Documents 1 and 6 (Section 4.1.4.1)\n\n- NIH Public Access Policy and copyright/licensing: Documents 2 and 7 (Section 8.2.2)\n\n- FOIA and protection of sensitive information: Documents 3, 5, 8, and 10 (Sections 2.3.11.2.2 and 2.3.11.2.3)\n\n- Subrecipient responsibilities and federal regulations (2 CFR 200.507(c)(3)): Document 10 (Section 2.3.11.2.3)\n\nIf further specific details on copyright ownership or licensing rights beyond public access requirements are needed, the documents do not provide explicit information."}

After the closeout of the Federal award, the recipient or subrecipient retains continuing responsibilities related to property management as appropriate, and any modification or termination of the relationship concerning the Federal award must consider these responsibilities and be done with the consent of the awarding Federal agency or pass-through entity (\u00a7 200.334(b), Documents 1 and 6).\n\nRegarding closeout procedures, \u00a7 200.344 outlines that the Federal agency or pass-through entity must close out the Federal award once all administrative actions and required work are completed. The recipient must submit all required reports (financial, performance, and others) no later than 120 calendar days after the period of performance ends, and must liquidate all financial obligations within the same timeframe (\u00a7 200.344(b) and (c), Documents 5 and 10). Subrecipients have similar but shorter deadlines (90 days) for reports and liquidation (\u00a7 200.344(b) and (c)).\n\nAdministrative costs associated with closeout activities, including costs related to the disposition of equipment and property, are allowable and may be charged to the Federal award until the due date of the final reports (\u00a7 200.414(b), Documents 3 and 8).\n\nIf, after closeout, amounts are due from the recipient or subrecipient (such as refunds, corrections, or final indirect cost rate adjustments), the closeout does not affect the Federal agency\u2019s right to disallow costs and recover funds based on later audits or reviews. The Federal agency or pass-through entity must make determinations to disallow costs and notify the recipient or subrecipient within the record retention period (\u00a7 200.339(a)(1) and (2), Documents 2 and 7).\n\nFurthermore, if subrecipients are noncompliant or fail to meet their obligations, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may pursue enforcement actions as appropriate (\u00a7 200.339, Document 2). The recipient or subrecipient must promptly refund any unobligated funds that are not authorized to be retained (\u00a7 200.344(e), Documents 5 and 10).\n\nIn summary:\n\n1. **Property Management and Disposal**: Follow \u00a7\u00a7 200.310 through 200.316 for property management and disposition. After closeout, responsibilities related to property management continue and any changes require consent from the Federal agency or pass-through entity (\u00a7 200.334).\n\n2. **Closeout Requirements**: Submit all required reports and liquidate obligations within 120 days (recipients) or 90 days (subrecipients) after the period of performance (\u00a7 200.344).\n\n3. **Allowable Closeout Costs**: Administrative costs related to closeout, including property disposition, are allowable until final reports are due (\u00a7 200.414).\n\n4. **Post-Closeout Actions**: The Federal agency retains rights to disallow costs and recover funds based on audits or reviews within the record retention period (\u00a7 200.339). Recipients must refund unobligated funds promptly (\u00a7 200.344(e)).\n\n5. **Enforcement for Noncompliance**: The Federal agency or pass-through entity may take enforcement actions if subrecipients are noncompliant (\u00a7 200.339).\n\nThese procedures ensure proper management, accountability, and compliance with Federal requirements during and after the closeout of Federal awards.\n\n**References:**  \n- Property management and continuing responsibilities: \u00a7\u00a7 200.310\u2013200.316 (implied), \u00a7 200.334 (Documents 1, 6)  \n- Closeout procedures and timelines: \u00a7 200.344 (Documents 5, 9, 10)  \n- Allowable closeout costs: \u00a7 200.414 (Documents 3, 8)  \n- Post-closeout rights and enforcement: \u00a7 200.339 (Documents 2, 7)"}
{"id": "applied_hard_19", "question": "According to NIH Grants Policy Statement sections 2.3.1 on Support Mechanisms and 2.3.2 on Eligibility, how should an institution determine if it qualifies to receive a specific NIH support mechanism, and once awarded, how must it comply with the public access requirements outlined in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.212 regarding Federal award information?", "prediction": "According to the NIH Grants Policy Statement (NIHGPS), the determination of whether an institution qualifies to receive a specific NIH support mechanism and the compliance requirements once awarded are addressed primarily in sections 2.3.1 (Support Mechanisms) and 2.3.2 (Eligibility), as well as related regulatory references.\n\n1. **Determining Eligibility to Receive a Specific NIH Support Mechanism**\n\n- **Support Mechanisms (Section 2.3.1):** NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) award grants under multiple programs and subprogram initiatives using a variety of support mechanisms. These mechanisms are distinguished by purpose, type of recipient, amount, and other characteristics. NIH uses an activity coding system (e.g., R01, F32, P01, R43) to indicate the category and specific form of support. The applicability of requirements may vary by activity code, and NIH ICs may differ in how they use specific codes. Not all ICs accept applications for all types of grant programs and may apply specialized eligibility criteria. Therefore, an institution should consult the specific activity codes relevant to the grant and the NIH IC\u2019s guidelines to determine if it qualifies for that support mechanism. A comprehensive list of activity codes is available on NIH\u2019s website (see Documents 4 and 9, Section 2.3.1).\n\n- **Eligibility (Section 2.3.2):** Generally, NIH grants may be awarded to a broad range of organizations, including domestic or foreign, public or private, non-profit or for-profit entities. Eligible organizations include governments (including Federal institutions), institutions of higher education, other non-profit organizations, hospitals, and, in rare cases, individuals. Any special eligibility criteria or requirements concerning the qualifications of the Principal Investigator (PD/PI) or other staff will be specified in the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), program guidelines, or other publicly available documents. Institutions should review these documents carefully to confirm eligibility (see Documents 1 and 6, Section 2.3.2).\n\n- **Pre-Award Process:** Institutions should complete the pre-award process, which includes determining applicant organization eligibility, as referenced in the eligibility section (Document 1, Section 2.3.2).\n\n2. **Compliance with Public Access Requirements Regarding Federal Award Information**\n\n- While the NIH Grants Policy Statement sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 do not explicitly detail public access requirements, compliance with federal award information reporting is governed by regulations such as 2 CFR \u00a7 200.212.\n\n- **Responsibility/Qualification Information in SAM.gov (Section 4.1.34):** NIH award recipients are subject to reporting requirements established by Public Law 112-239 (National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013) and detailed in Appendix XII to 2 CFR Part 200. Specifically, NIH recipients with currently active Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 must report responsibility and qualification information in the System for Award Management (SAM.gov). This ensures transparency and public access to Federal award information (see Document 5 and 10, Section 4.1.34).\n\n- **Implication for NIH Recipients:** Once awarded, institutions must comply with these federal reporting requirements, which include maintaining up-to-date information in SAM.gov and adhering to any public access policies stipulated by NIH and federal regulations. This compliance facilitates public access to information about Federal awards and supports accountability.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- To determine if an institution qualifies for a specific NIH support mechanism, it should:\n\n  - Identify the relevant NIH activity code(s) and review the specific NIH IC\u2019s program guidelines and NOFOs for eligibility criteria (2.3.1 Support Mechanisms).\n\n  - Confirm that the institution type (e.g., government, higher education, non-profit, for-profit) and the qualifications of key personnel meet the eligibility requirements outlined in the NOFO and NIH policy (2.3.2 Eligibility).\n\n- Once awarded, the institution must comply with public access and reporting requirements as mandated by federal law and regulations, including maintaining responsibility and qualification information in SAM.gov per 2 CFR \u00a7 200.212 and Public Law 112-239, ensuring transparency of Federal award information.\n\n**References:**\n\n- NIH Grants Policy Statement, Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 (Documents 1, 4, 6, 9)\n\n- Responsibility/Qualification Information in SAM.gov, Section 4.1.34 (Documents 5, 10)\n\n- 2 CFR \u00a7 200.212 (as referenced in Document 5 and 10)\n\nThis comprehensive approach ensures that institutions understand their eligibility for NIH grants and their obligations to comply with federal public access and reporting requirements once awarded."}
{"id": "applied_hard_20", "question": "According to 2 CFR Part 200 Appendix VII B.7 and the NIH Grants Policy Statement section 12.3.6 on Level of Effort, how should a recipient manage and document the level of effort during the period of performance, especially when program income is generated? Specifically, how do the cost principles in 2 CFR 200.344(d) and (e) affect the treatment of costs incidental to generating program income and the classification of certain revenues, and what are the implications for closeout reporting under the Uniform Administrative Requirements?", "prediction": "Based on the retrieved documents, the management and documentation of level of effort during the period of performance, especially when program income is generated, and the treatment of costs incidental to generating program income under 2 CFR Part 200 Appendix VII B.7 and the NIH Grants Policy Statement section 12.3.6, can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Management and Documentation of Level of Effort During the Period of Performance**\n\n- While the retrieved documents do not explicitly quote 2 CFR Part 200 Appendix VII B.7 or NIH Grants Policy Statement section 12.3.6 verbatim regarding level of effort, general NIH grant administration principles apply.\n\n- NIH requires recipients to manage expenditures and effort consistent with the approved budget and programmatic objectives. NIH allows some flexibility to deviate from the award budget during performance to accomplish programmatic objectives, but significant changes require prior NIH approval (Documents 3 and 8, Section 7.1).\n\n- Recipients must maintain accurate and complete financial records consistent with their accounting systems and certify that all expenditures and obligations are for the purposes set forth in the grant documents (Documents 2 and 7, Section 8.4.1.5.2).\n\n- Financial expenditure reports (FFRs) must be submitted timely and accurately, documenting expenditures and program income for each budget period or competitive segment (Documents 2 and 7, Section 8.4.1.5.2).\n\n- The level of effort should be documented through these financial and progress reports, ensuring that the recipient meets the commitment of effort and cost sharing, if applicable (Documents 1 and 6, Section 2 CFR Appendix I to Part 200(b)(2)(ii)(A)).\n\n2. **Treatment of Costs Incidental to Generating Program Income (2 CFR 200.344(d))**\n\n- According to 2 CFR 200.344(d) (Documents 4 and 9), if authorized by Federal regulations or the Federal award, costs incidental to generating program income may be deducted from the gross income to determine the net program income, provided these costs have not been charged to the Federal award.\n\n- This means that when program income is generated, the recipient can subtract reasonable costs directly related to generating that income from the gross amount before reporting the net program income.\n\n- However, these costs must not have been charged to the Federal award already, ensuring no double charging.\n\n3. **Classification of Certain Revenues Not Considered Program Income (2 CFR 200.344(e))**\n\n- Per 2 CFR 200.344(e) (Documents 4 and 9), certain revenues are not considered program income unless specified otherwise by statutes, regulations, or award terms:\n\n  - Governmental revenues such as taxes, special assessments, levies, fines, and similar revenues raised by the recipient or subrecipient.\n\n  - Proceeds from the sale of real property, equipment, or supplies.\n\n- This classification affects how these revenues are treated in financial reporting and closeout.\n\n4. **Implications for Closeout Reporting Under the Uniform Administrative Requirements**\n\n- Program income earned and expended must be reported on the appropriate annual financial report, currently the Federal Financial Report (FFR) (Documents 5 and 10, Section 8.3.2.1).\n\n- The net program income (gross income minus allowable costs incidental to generating the income) should be reported in the Program Income section of the FFR (lines 10 L \u2013 O).\n\n- Accurate reporting of program income and associated costs is critical for closeout, as the FFR serves as documentation of the financial status of the grant at closeout (Documents 2, 5, 7, and 10).\n\n- The Grants Management Officer (GMO) or designee monitors expenditures and program income for compliance and may use audit findings for final cost adjustments during closeout (Documents 3 and 8, Section 7.1).\n\n- Failure to submit timely and accurate reports, including proper documentation of program income and costs, may affect future funding and could result in penalties (Documents 2 and 7).\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Recipients must manage and document their level of effort and expenditures consistent with the approved budget and programmatic objectives, submitting accurate and timely financial expenditure reports (FFRs) through NIH systems.\n\n- When program income is generated, costs incidental to generating that income may be deducted from gross income to report net program income, provided these costs have not been charged to the Federal award (2 CFR 200.344(d)).\n\n- Certain revenues such as governmental revenues and proceeds from property sales are not considered program income unless otherwise specified (2 CFR 200.344(e)).\n\n- Program income and related costs must be reported in the FFR during the period of performance and at closeout, ensuring compliance with Uniform Administrative Requirements and NIH policies.\n\n- The GMO monitors compliance and may require prior approvals for significant budget deviations, and audit findings may influence final cost adjustments at closeout.\n\n**References:**\n\n- 2 CFR Part 200.344(d) and (e) (Documents 4 and 9)\n\n- NIH Grants Policy Statement, Financial Expenditure Reports and Closeout (Documents 2, 5, 7, and 10)\n\n- NIH Grants Policy Statement, Cost Principles and Monitoring (Documents 3 and 8)\n\n- 2 CFR Appendix I to Part 200(b)(2)(ii)(A) on cost sharing and program description (Documents 1 and 6)\n\nThis comprehensive approach ensures proper management, documentation, and reporting of level of effort and program income in compliance with federal regulations and NIH policies."}
{"id": "applied_hard_21", "question": "According to 2 CFR 200.448(b)(2)(iii), how should an organization allocate costs for a grant when additional review criteria outlined in NIH GPS section 2.4.1.4 apply, and how can the organization contact the appropriate Cost Allocation Services office for assistance if located in California?", "prediction": "According to 2 CFR 200.448(b)(2)(iii), when additional review criteria outlined in NIH Grants Policy Statement (NIH GPS) section 2.4.1.4 apply, an organization should allocate costs for a grant by following a reasonable and consistent basis that identifies and assigns central service costs to benefitted activities. This involves the use of a central service cost allocation plan, which is a process to distribute costs of centralized services (such as motor pools, computer centers, purchasing, accounting, etc.) to the operating agencies that benefit from them. The costs and data used in this allocation must be supported by formal accounting and other records to ensure the propriety of the costs assigned to Federal awards (see Document 5, Section 2 CFR Appendix V to Part 200).\n\nSpecifically, the central service cost allocation plan distinguishes between:\n- Allocated central services: services that benefit operating agencies but are not billed on a fee-for-service basis and are allocated on a reasonable basis.\n- Billed central services: services billed to benefitted agencies on a fee-for-service or similar basis (Document 5).\n\nThe NIH GPS section 2.4.1.4 likely refers to these principles and requires that organizations use such allocation plans to ensure costs are assigned commensurate with the benefits provided to individual projects or activities.\n\nFor organizations located in California seeking assistance with cost allocation, they can contact the appropriate Cost Allocation Services (CAS) office. According to Document 5 (2 CFR Appendix V to Part 200), a brochure entitled \u201cA Guide for State, Local and Indian Tribal Governments: Cost Principles and Procedures for Developing Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Rates for Agreements with the Federal Government\u201d is available from the HHS Cost Allocation Services or at their website. This office provides guidance and assistance on developing cost allocation plans and indirect cost rates.\n\nWhile the documents do not provide a direct phone number or email for the California CAS office, the standard procedure is to contact the HHS Cost Allocation Services, which serves as the cognizant agency for cost allocation plans for state and local governments, including those in California.\n\nIn summary:\n\n1. **Cost Allocation Methodology:**\n   - Use a central service cost allocation plan to allocate central service costs to benefitted activities on a reasonable and consistent basis.\n   - Ensure all costs and data used are supported by formal accounting records.\n   - Distinguish between allocated central services and billed central services.\n   - Follow the additional review criteria in NIH GPS section 2.4.1.4, which aligns with 2 CFR 200.448(b)(2)(iii) requirements (Document 5).\n\n2. **Contacting Cost Allocation Services for Assistance in California:**\n   - Contact the HHS Cost Allocation Services office for guidance.\n   - Obtain the brochure \u201cA Guide for State, Local and Indian Tribal Governments\u201d from HHS Cost Allocation Services or their website for detailed procedures and contact information (Document 5).\n\nNo specific contact details for the California office are provided in the retrieved documents, but HHS Cost Allocation Services is the responsible entity for assistance.\n\n**References:**\n- Document 5: 2 CFR Appendix V to Part 200\u2014State/Local Governmentwide Central Service Cost Allocation Plans.\n- NIH GPS section 2.4.1.4 as referenced in the question (not fully included in the documents but related to cost allocation principles).\n- Guidance on contacting HHS Cost Allocation Services for assistance (Document 5)."}
{"id": "applied_hard_22", "question": "For an independent (non-mentored) NIH Career Development Award (CDA) recipient who is conducting clinical research involving research patients in a hospital setting, how should the research patient care costs be identified and allocated according to NIH guidelines, and what are the key exclusions from these costs? Additionally, how do the Uniform Administrative Requirements under 2 CFR Part 200.410 influence the allowability of these costs under the grant award?", "prediction": "For an independent (non-mentored) NIH Career Development Award (CDA) recipient conducting clinical research involving research patients in a hospital setting, the NIH guidelines for identifying and allocating research patient care costs, key exclusions, and the influence of Uniform Administrative Requirements under 2 CFR Part 200.410 are as follows:\n\n1. Identification and Allocation of Research Patient Care Costs\n\n- General Policy Framework:  \nNIH policy on research patient care costs under grants is provided in conjunction with 2 CFR Part 200, Appendix IX, Hospital Cost Principles (Documents 1 and 6, Section 19.1). This means that the determination and reimbursement of these costs must align with federal cost principles for hospitals.\n\n- Requirement for Research Patient Care Rate Agreement:  \nHospitals that expect to incur more than $100,000 in research patient care costs in any single budget period on a single NIH grant must have or negotiate a research patient care rate agreement with the cognizant Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) office. This negotiated rate must be used in all reimbursement requests or claims (Documents 2 and 7, Section 19.3). Failure to negotiate when required may lead to disallowance of all such costs charged to the grant.\n\n- Computation of Costs:  \nResearch patient care costs should be computed consistent with Medicare principles and procedures for reasonable costs. Separate cost centers must be established for each discrete bed unit to allocate or distribute allowable routine costs appropriately (Documents 4 and 9, Section 19.4.1). Provisional rates, if used, set the maximum NIH reimbursement and must be adjusted if a lower final rate is negotiated.\n\n- Determining Allowable Costs:  \nThe key factor is whether the patient care or services differ from usual care or result in additional expenses due to the research. If the care or services are the same as usual care and would have been incurred regardless of the study, those costs are generally not allowable (Documents 3 and 8, Section 19.4).  \nCosts are allowable when:  \n  - The research extends hospitalization beyond usual care, or  \n  - The research imposes additional procedures, tests, or services beyond usual care, inpatient or outpatient.  \nThe recipient must document and decide the extent to which hospitalization or services are extended or added due to research.\n\n- Special Allowable Exceptions:  \nNIH funds may cover all costs (usual care and research care) for individuals who would not have been hospitalized or received tests/services except for participation in the research. Examples include:  \n  - Volunteers with no expected health benefit (e.g., normal controls, healthy individuals in vaccine trials)  \n  - Individuals hospitalized solely for research purposes (Documents 3 and 8, Section 19.4).\n\n2. Key Exclusions from Research Patient Care Costs\n\n- Costs for patients receiving accepted standard treatments according to standard regimens are generally excluded.  \n- In clinical trials comparing accepted treatments to new therapies, only costs for measurements or services above usual care specified by the protocol are allowable.  \n- Usual patient care costs that would have been incurred regardless of the research are excluded (Documents 3 and 8, Section 19.4).\n\n3. Influence of Uniform Administrative Requirements under 2 CFR Part 200.410\n\n- The general NIH policy is intended to be applied in conjunction with 2 CFR Part 200, Appendix IX, Hospital Cost Principles, which are part of the Uniform Administrative Requirements (Documents 1 and 6, Section 19.1).  \n- Specifically, 2 CFR Part 200.410 addresses the allowability of costs under federal awards, requiring that costs be necessary, reasonable, allocable, and conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in the award or federal regulations.  \n- Therefore, research patient care costs must meet these criteria to be allowable under the NIH grant. This means that only costs that are allocable to the research, reasonable in amount, and consistent with the terms of the award and federal cost principles can be charged to the grant.  \n- The requirement to negotiate research patient care rates with the CAS office and to use those rates in reimbursement aligns with these principles to ensure costs are reasonable and allocable (Documents 2, 4, 7, and 9, Sections 19.3 and 19.4.1).\n\nSummary:\n\n- For an independent NIH CDA recipient conducting clinical research in a hospital, research patient care costs must be identified by distinguishing between usual patient care costs and additional costs incurred due to research activities.  \n- Hospitals expecting over $100,000 in such costs per budget period must negotiate research patient care rates with the CAS office, which are then used for reimbursement claims.  \n- Allowable costs include additional hospitalization days, tests, or services beyond usual care, and all costs for individuals hospitalized solely for research purposes or volunteers with no expected health benefit.  \n- Exclusions include costs for standard accepted treatments and usual care costs that would have been incurred regardless of the research.  \n- All costs must comply with the Uniform Administrative Requirements under 2 CFR Part 200.410, ensuring they are necessary, reasonable, allocable, and consistent with federal cost principles and NIH policies.\n\nReferences:  \n- NIH Grants Policy Statement, Chapter 19: Research Patient Care Costs (Sections 19.1, 19.3, 19.4, 19.4.1) [Documents 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]  \n- NIH Grants Policy Statement, Chapter 12: Career Development Awards (Sections 12.1) [Documents 5, 10]  \n- 2 CFR Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements (Referenced in Documents 1 and 6)"}

Additionally, travel costs and recipient integrity are governed by specific sections (\u00a7\u00a7 200.113 and 200.432) that outline federal approvals and guidelines.\n\n### Determination and Application of Indirect Cost Rates for Nonprofit Organizations\n\n1. **Definition and Identification of Indirect Costs**  \n   Indirect costs are those incurred for common or joint objectives and cannot be readily identified with a particular final cost objective (Appendix IV, Part B.1, Documents 1 and 6). Minor direct costs may be treated as indirect costs if appropriate.\n\n2. **Rate Determination and Negotiation**  \n   - Indirect cost rates must be negotiated and approved by the **cognizant agency for indirect costs**, which is the federal agency responsible for negotiating and approving indirect cost rates on behalf of all federal agencies (Appendix IV, Section 5.C.1.a, Document 3 and 8).  \n   - Rates may be **predetermined**, **fixed**, **provisional**, or **final**:  \n     - *Predetermined rates* are based on estimated costs for a current or future period and are not subject to adjustment.  \n     - *Fixed rates* are similar but differences between estimated and actual costs are carried forward to subsequent periods.  \n     - *Provisional and final rates* must be negotiated when predetermined or fixed rates are not appropriate, with final rates based on actual costs (Documents 2, 3, 7, and 8).  \n   - The negotiation results must be formalized in a **written agreement** between the nonprofit and the cognizant agency, and copies must be made available to all concerned federal agencies (Documents 2 and 7).\n\n3. **Certification Requirements**  \n   - Each indirect cost rate proposal must be accompanied by a **Certificate of Indirect (F&A) Costs**, signed by an official at a level no lower than vice president or chief financial officer (Documents 2 and 7).  \n   - The certification attests that:  \n     - The proposal has been reviewed;  \n     - All costs included are allowable under federal awards and Subpart E of Part 200;  \n     - The proposal excludes unallowable costs such as public relations, entertainment, lobbying, fines, penalties, and defense of fraud proceedings;  \n     - Costs are properly allocable to federal awards based on a beneficial or causal relationship (Documents 2 and 7).  \n\n4. **Special Considerations**  \n   - Separate indirect cost pools and rates may be developed for particular segments of work if they generate significantly different levels of indirect costs (Documents 3 and 8).  \n   - Disputes in negotiation are resolved according to the cognizant agency\u2019s appeals procedures, with OMB assistance if needed (Documents 2 and 7).\n\n### Application Regarding Travel Costs Without an Established Written Policy\n\n- According to \u00a7 200.432 (Travel Costs), travel costs are allowable if they are reasonable and conform to the organization\u2019s written travel policy.  \n- If a nonprofit organization **does not have an established written travel policy**, travel costs must be treated carefully:  \n  - The costs must still be reasonable and consistent with federal cost principles.  \n  - Without a written policy, the organization risks disallowance of travel costs or the need for federal agency approval.  \n  - It is best practice to establish a written travel policy that aligns with federal guidelines to ensure compliance and allowability of travel expenses (implied from \u00a7 200.432 and general cost principles in Subpart E).  \n- Travel costs are generally considered direct costs and should not be included in indirect cost pools unless specifically allowed.\n\n### Federal Approvals and Guidelines Regarding Travel Expenses and Recipient Integrity\n\n1. **Travel Expenses (\u00a7 200.432)**  \n   - Travel costs must be consistent with the organization\u2019s written travel policy and reasonable for the performance of the federal award.  \n   - Costs must be supported by documentation and comply with federal cost principles (Document references to \u00a7 200.432 are implied from the question; specific text not provided in the documents but referenced in the question).\n\n2. **Recipient Integrity and Performance Matters (Appendix XII to Part 200)**  \n   - Appendix XII establishes award terms and conditions related to **recipient integrity and performance**.  \n   - Federal agencies must consider recipient integrity, business ethics, and performance when awarding federal funds (Document 5 and 10).  \n   - This includes requirements for reporting and compliance that affect the administration of federal awards and may impact indirect cost rate negotiations and approvals.\n\n3. **Exemptions (Appendix VIII to Part 200)**  \n   - Appendix VIII lists nonprofit organizations exempted from Subpart E of Part 200, which includes cost principles.  \n   - Such exemptions affect how indirect costs and travel costs are treated and may require special consideration or alternative compliance methods (Documents 5 and 10).\n\n### Summary\n\n- Nonprofit organizations must develop indirect cost rates through negotiation with the cognizant federal agency, formalized by written agreements, and accompanied by required certifications signed by senior officials (Appendix IV, Documents 2, 3, 7, 8).  \n- Indirect cost rates can be predetermined, fixed, provisional, or final, with adjustments made as appropriate.  \n- Travel costs must be reasonable, supported, and consistent with a written travel policy; lacking such a policy may jeopardize allowability under \u00a7 200.432.  \n- Recipient integrity and performance requirements under Appendix XII must be followed, ensuring compliance with federal award terms and conditions.  \n- Nonprofits exempted under Appendix VIII have specific provisions that may alter the application of these cost principles.\n\n**References:**  \n- Appendix IV to Part 200 (Indirect Costs for Nonprofits): Documents 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8  \n- Appendix VIII to Part 200 (Exemptions): Documents 5, 10  \n- Appendix XII to Part 200 (Recipient Integrity): Documents 5, 10  \n- \u00a7\u00a7 200.113 and 200.432 (Travel and Recipient Integrity): Referenced in question;

{"id": "applied_hard_25", "question": "Considering the definitions and types of Federal awards and clusters provided in 2 CFR 200.1, including fixed amount awards which reduce administrative burdens, how do the limitations on pre-award costs for individual fellowships described in NIH GPS 11.2.9.1 interact with the cost principles outlined in 2 CFR 200.431(b)(3)(i), particularly regarding charging stipends, tuition, and institutional allowances before award activation? Specifically, can a sponsoring institution charge pre-award costs such as stipends or tuition under a fixed amount award for an individual fellowship, and what steps should be taken to ensure compliance with both NIH and federal regulations?", "prediction": "Based on the retrieved documents, the interaction between the limitations on pre-award costs for individual fellowships described in NIH GPS 11.2.9.1 and the federal cost principles outlined in 2 CFR 200.431(b)(3)(i) (and related cost principles in 2 CFR Part 200, Subpart E) can be understood as follows:\n\n1. **Nature of Individual Fellowships and Applicability of Cost Principles**\n\n- Individual fellowships, such as Kirschstein-NRSA fellowships, are governed by specific NIH policies that differ from typical research grants. According to Document 4 (Section 7.2), the federal cost principles at 2 CFR Part 200, Subpart E generally apply to NIH grants but **do not apply to Kirschstein-NRSA individual fellowship awards**. Instead, the allowable use of funds under these fellowships is governed by the specific NIH policies detailed in the Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards (IIB section).\n\n- Stipends under these fellowships are considered cost-of-living allowances and are not fee-for-service payments; they are not subject to the cost accounting requirements of the federal cost principles (Document 10, Section chapter_in IIB).\n\n2. **Limitations on Pre-Award Costs for Individual Fellowships**\n\n- Document 1 and Document 6 (both Section 11.2.9.1) clearly state that **stipends and tuition and fees may not be charged as pre-award costs to an individual fellowship**. These costs can only be charged after the fellow has activated the award and the appropriate paperwork has been submitted to NIH.\n\n- There are rare exceptions where costs associated with the **institutional allowance** may be allowable as pre-award costs, but this requires consultation with the NIH awarding Institute or Center (IC).\n\n3. **Fixed Amount Awards and Administrative Burden**\n\n- While the question references fixed amount awards (which are designed to reduce administrative burden by providing a set amount rather than reimbursement of actual costs), the documents do not explicitly discuss fixed amount awards in the context of individual fellowships or pre-award costs.\n\n- However, since individual fellowships are governed by specific NIH policies that override general federal cost principles, the restrictions on pre-award costs (stipends and tuition) apply regardless of the award type.\n\n4. **Charging Pre-Award Costs Such as Stipends or Tuition**\n\n- Because stipends and tuition are explicitly prohibited as pre-award charges for individual fellowships until award activation (Documents 1 and 6), **a sponsoring institution cannot charge these costs as pre-award costs under a fixed amount award for an individual fellowship**.\n\n- Institutional allowances may be an exception but require prior consultation and approval from the NIH awarding IC.\n\n5. **Ensuring Compliance with NIH and Federal Regulations**\n\n- Sponsoring institutions should:\n\n  - **Not charge stipends or tuition as pre-award costs** for individual fellowships before award activation.\n\n  - **Consult with the NIH awarding IC** if considering charging any pre-award costs related to institutional allowances, as these are rare and require NIH approval (Documents 1 and 6).\n\n  - Use their own accounting systems and policies consistent with 2 CFR Part 200.302 for financial management systems, ensuring that costs are allowable, allocable, and reasonable (Document 4).\n\n  - Recognize that the NIH Standard Terms of Award apply to individual fellowships but with specific exceptions (e.g., no carryover of unobligated balances) (Document 2 and Document 7).\n\n  - Understand that stipends under individual fellowships are not subject to the federal cost principles but are governed by NIH-specific policies (Document 4 and Document 10).\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Stipends and tuition cannot be charged as pre-award costs for individual fellowships, including under fixed amount awards, until the award is activated and paperwork is submitted to NIH.**\n\n- **Institutional allowances may be charged as pre-award costs only in rare cases with prior NIH IC consultation and approval.**\n\n- **The federal cost principles at 2 CFR Part 200 generally do not apply to Kirschstein-NRSA individual fellowships; instead, NIH-specific policies govern allowable costs.**\n\n- **To ensure compliance, sponsoring institutions must follow NIH GPS restrictions on pre-award costs, consult NIH awarding IC when in doubt, and maintain proper financial management systems consistent with federal standards.**\n\n**References:**\n\n- NIH GPS 11.2.9.1 Pre-award Costs (Documents 1 and 6)\n\n- NIH GPS 11.2.13.8 Applicability of NIH Standard Terms of Award (Documents 2 and 7)\n\n- NIH GPS Section 7.2 The Cost Principles (Documents 4 and 9)\n\n- NIH GPS Section 17.6 Allowable and Unallowable Costs (Documents 3 and 8)\n\n- NIH GPS Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards policies (Documents 4 and 10)\n\nThis comprehensive understanding ensures that sponsoring institutions do not improperly charge stipends or tuition as pre-award costs and remain compliant with both NIH and federal regulations."}

{"id": "applied_hard_27", "question": "How should a recipient manage and justify short-term health-professional research training costs within an NIH award budget, considering the NIH peer review process for budget adjustments, the monthly limitation on training-related expenses, and the federal regulations on costs for conferences and training under 2 CFR 200.463(d)(4)?", "prediction": "To manage and justify short-term health-professional research training costs within an NIH award budget, recipients should consider the following key points derived from NIH policies and federal regulations:\n\n1. **Monthly Limitation on Short-Term Training Costs**  \n   Recipients may receive up to one-twelfth of the annual amount designated for training-related expenses each month to cover costs such as tuition, fees, travel, supplies, and other expenses for each short-term health-professional research training position. This means that the budget for short-term training costs is distributed evenly across months, and expenditures should not exceed this monthly allocation (see Documents 1 and 6, Section 11.3.8.6).\n\n2. **Allowable Training-Related Expenses and Budgeting**  \n   Training-related expenses include staff salaries, consultant costs, equipment, research supplies, staff travel, trainee health insurance (self-only or family), and other expenses directly related to the training program. These funds are requested and awarded as a lump sum based on predetermined amounts per trainee type (predoctoral, postdoctoral, short-term, etc.) as published in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts.  \n   Institutions should allocate costs appropriately when the training grant supports only some trainees in a larger institutional program and apply core cost principles such as allocation and consistent treatment. Health insurance and special insurances (e.g., medical liability insurance) are allowable only if consistently applied to all similarly situated trainees regardless of funding source and if required by the nature of the training.  \n   Other allowable costs may include speaker fees and meals if related to program-required activities or ancillary meetings. Extraordinary costs, such as accommodations for disabilities, may be requested but require detailed justification and prior consultation with NIH program staff (see Documents 2 and 7, Section 11.3.8.4).\n\n3. **Budget Justification and NIH Peer Review Process**  \n   For research career development awards (e.g., K awards), detailed budget information is required at the time of application, including senior/key person information and total requested research development support. A budget justification must provide a detailed description of specific research development support costs. NIH peer review considers these justifications when evaluating the budget. If necessary, NIH may adjust the award to avoid budget overlap or to align with allowable costs and levels of effort (see Documents 3, 5, 8, and 10, Sections 12.3.6.2 and 12.4.1.5).\n\n4. **Compliance with Federal Cost Principles and Regulations**  \n   All costs must comply with applicable federal cost principles, including those outlined in 2 CFR Part 200. Specifically, for conferences and training costs, 2 CFR 200.463(d)(4) governs allowable costs. This regulation requires that costs for conferences and training be reasonable, allocable, and necessary for the performance of the federal award. Recipients must ensure that costs charged to the NIH award are consistent with institutional policies and federal guidelines, including documentation and justification of expenses.  \n   NIH policies on research patient care costs and other specific program requirements must also be considered in conjunction with these federal regulations (see Document 4, Section 19.1, and reference to 2 CFR 200.463(d)(4)).\n\n**Summary of Best Practices for Managing and Justifying Short-Term Training Costs:**\n\n- **Budgeting:** Allocate short-term training costs monthly, not exceeding one-twelfth of the annual training-related expenses per month per trainee.  \n- **Allowable Costs:** Include tuition, fees, travel, supplies, health insurance (if consistent), staff salaries, speaker fees, and meals related to training activities.  \n- **Justification:** Provide detailed budget justifications in applications, explaining any extraordinary costs or deviations from standard levels.  \n- **Consistency and Allocation:** Apply cost principles consistently across trainees and allocate shared costs appropriately.  \n- **Compliance:** Ensure all costs comply with NIH policies and federal regulations, including 2 CFR 200.463(d)(4) for conferences and training.  \n- **Consultation:** Engage NIH program staff early when requesting additional or extraordinary costs to ensure acceptability.\n\nBy following these guidelines, recipients can effectively manage and justify short-term health-professional research training costs within NIH award budgets, ensuring compliance with NIH peer review expectations, monthly cost limitations, and federal cost regulations.\n\n**References:**  \n- Short-Term Training Costs: Documents 1 and 6 (Section 11.3.8.6)  \n- Training-Related Expenses and Allowable Costs: Documents 2 and 7 (Section 11.3.8.4)  \n- NIH Peer Review and Budget Justification: Documents 3, 5, 8, and 10 (Sections 12.3.6.2 and 12.4.1.5)  \n- Federal Cost Principles and 2 CFR 200.463(d)(4): Document 4 (Section 19.1)"}

These systems must ensure that obligations and expenditures are reasonable, allocable, and allowable (Documents 1 and 6, Section 8.3.1).\n   \n   - The financial management system must be capable of identifying:\n     - Large unobligated balances,\n     - Accelerated expenditures,\n     - Inappropriate cost transfers,\n     - Other inappropriate obligations and expenditures of funds.\n   \n   - Recipients are required to notify NIH promptly when any problems or discrepancies are identified in the management of funds (Documents 1 and 6, Section 8.3.1).\n   \n   - Failure to establish adequate control systems is considered a material violation of the award terms and may result in NIH imposing specific conditions or enforcement actions (Documents 1 and 6, Section 8.3.1).\n   \n   - Expenditures must be reported accurately on either a cash or accrual basis, consistently applied and disclosed, including direct charges, indirect costs, third-party contributions, and payments to subrecipients (Documents 3 and 8, Part I Glossary).\n\n2. **Handling of Other Income and Amounts Due (2 CFR \u00a7 200.346)**\n\n   - Although the documents provided do not explicitly detail 2 CFR \u00a7 200.346, this regulation generally addresses the treatment of program income (other income generated related to the Federal award).\n   \n   - Under 2 CFR \u00a7 200.346, any program income earned must be used in accordance with the terms of the award, which typically requires that amounts due to be collected from other income sources be:\n     - Reported accurately,\n     - Properly accounted for,\n     - Returned to the Federal government if required, or\n     - Used to further eligible project objectives as specified in the award terms.\n   \n   - Recipients must maintain adequate documentation and internal controls to track such income and ensure compliance with NIH and Federal requirements.\n   \n   - If amounts are due to be collected (e.g., repayments or recoveries related to the Loan Repayment Program), the recipient must follow NIH instructions for collection and disposition of these funds, ensuring they are properly recorded and reported.\n   \n   - Any failure to comply with these requirements may be considered a material violation and subject to enforcement actions by NIH (Documents 1 and 6, Section 8.3.1).\n\n3. **Audit and Oversight**\n\n   - Recipients and consortium participants expending $750,000 or more annually under Federal awards must have audits conducted in accordance with 2 CFR Part 200.501 (Subpart F) (Documents 2 and 7).\n   \n   - The recipient must obtain and review audit reports from consortium participants meeting the threshold and take appropriate action to resolve any findings related to the NIH award.\n   \n   - For consortium participants below the threshold, the recipient is responsible for monitoring compliance with NIH requirements (Documents 2 and 7).\n   \n   - Audit requirements ensure that financial management and budget monitoring systems are functioning properly and that any program income or other income is handled correctly.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Establish and maintain a robust financial management system with internal controls to monitor NIH grant funds, including those for Loan Repayment Program postdoctoral fellows, ensuring expenditures are reasonable, allocable, and allowable (2 CFR \u00a7 200.303(5); Documents 1 and 6).\n- Identify and report any irregularities or problems to NIH promptly.\n- Accurately track and manage any program income or other income sources related to the award, following NIH and Federal regulations for collection, reporting, and disposition of such funds (2 CFR \u00a7 200.346).\n- Ensure compliance through required audits and oversight of consortium participants as applicable (2 CFR Part 200.501; Documents 2 and 7).\n- Failure to comply with these requirements may result in enforcement actions by NIH.\n\n**References:**\n\n- Documents 1 and 6, Section 8.3.1: Financial management system requirements and monitoring.\n- Documents 2 and 7: Audit requirements under 2 CFR Part 200.501.\n- Documents 3 and 8, Part I Glossary: Definitions related to expenditures and reporting.\n- General understanding of 2 CFR \u00a7 200.346 on program income (not explicitly detailed in the provided documents but referenced in NIH policy context).\n\nIf further specific procedural details under 2 CFR \u00a7 200.346 are needed, consulting the full text of 2 CFR Part 200 or NIH Grants Policy Statement sections on program income is recommended, as the provided documents do not contain detailed procedural steps for amounts due to be collected."}
{"id": "applied_hard_30", "question": "How must an NIH recipient subject to audit requirements under 2 CFR Part 200 ensure compliance with internal control standards and financial reporting during an audit, and how does the tax treatment of Kirschstein-NRSA stipends under Section 117 of the Internal Revenue Code affect the classification of these stipends in relation to the recipient's employment status with NIH or the sponsoring institution?", "prediction": "An NIH recipient subject to audit requirements under 2 CFR Part 200 must ensure compliance with internal control standards and financial reporting during an audit by adhering to the detailed provisions of 2 CFR Part 200, Subpart F\u2014Audit Requirements. The key compliance steps and audit requirements are as follows:\n\n1. **Audit Threshold and Scope**:  \n   Organizations (such as State governments, local governments, non-profit organizations, including institutions of higher education) that expend $750,000 or more per year in Federal awards must have an annual audit performed by a public accountant or a Federal, State, or local governmental audit organization. The audit must comply with generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS) (Documents 1, 5, 6, 10).\n\n2. **Audit Type**:  \n   If the Federal awards are under one program, the recipient may elect to have either a single organization-wide audit or a program-specific audit of that program.
